# Death Penalty

## Consensus

* Most criminologists **agree that the death penalty doesn't act as a deterrent to the commitment to murder**. ([Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/files/DeterrenceStudy2009.pdf#page=17)  )

## Ineffectiveness&#xD;

* No evidence that Oklahoma’s reintroduction of execution **produced a statistically significant decrease in the level of criminal homicides during the period under investigation**. ([Criminology](https://sci-hub.st/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1994.tb01148.x))
* Our estimates suggest not just “reasonable doubt” about whether there is any deterrent effect of the death penalty, **but profound uncertainty**. ([Stanford Law Review](http://users.nber.org/\~jwolfers/papers/DeathPenalty\(SLR\).pdf#page=4))
