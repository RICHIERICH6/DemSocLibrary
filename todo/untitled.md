# Abortion Philosophical Argument

The most common pro-life position is basically:

* Premise 1: The human fetus has the right to life.
* Premise 2: If the fetus has a right to life, then abortion is morally impermissible.
* Conclusion: Abortion is morally impermissible.

Now whether or not you agree with Premise 1 is fine, but we as humans agree that there is not one "right to life" but a range. For example, an animal may have a lower right to life than a human \(even vegan philosophers agree with this\) but a right to life nonetheless. To illustrate this, if you were driving on the road, and saw a sentient 4 year old child and an artificial womb with a fetus inside, and swerving the car would save the child but kill the artificial womb. Even if you agree that the fetus has the right to life, I assume you would swerve the car to save the child instead of the non sentient fetus.

Let's say you wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist’s circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, “Look, we’re sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you – we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it’s only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.\[^1\]\[^2\]

## Tacit Consent

A pro-lifer could argue against this by saying that the violinist situation is coercive while the pregnancy was a result of the mother \(assuming we forget rape cases, although those are a small percentage of abortion cases\), because the woman in nonrape cases is responsible for the fact that there is a fetus whose life now depends on the use of her body in order to survive, the fetus has acquired a right to the use of her body even if the woman has not “given” this right to the fetus, explicitly or otherwise, in which I give this hypothetical:

You voluntarily checked into the hospital on December 31, 1999, for some optional cosmetic surgery, knowing that a Y2K-related computer error could result in you having the wrong operation done, a type of mistake you knew happens from time to time even when there are no computer difficulties. Your friends warned you against taking such risks with your body, but you disregarded their advice. After falling asleep for the evening, you awoke to find that, despite the fact that no one had done anything to you that they weren't meant to do, you had been accidentally plugged into the ailing violinist due to a computer error. In this version of the story, there is no culpable human agent who plugs you into the violinist. As in the case of the conception of the fetus resulting from voluntary intercourse, your becoming plugged into the violinist is merely the result of a random occurrence, though one that could only occur because a prior act of yours had made it possible for it to occur. But surely no one will say that because you knew that this random event might occur after you checked yourself into the hospital, your checking yourself in counts as consent to remain plugged into the violinist. And so, by parity of reasoning, we cannot say that because the woman who engaged in voluntary intercourse knew that conception might occur, her engaging in intercourse counts as consent to carry her pregnancy to term.\[^3\]

If my niece required a kidney transplant, and I donated my kidney, but before they took the kidney from me, I would revoke the donation. Should the doctors still force the kidney out of me? I actually consented to it but then revoked my consent before it happened. Even if a woman says they 100% want to get pregnant, why shouldn’t they have the ability to change their mind the same way I can keep my kidney even if I consciously request to donate it to someone?

If the room is stuffy, and I therefore open a window to air it, and a burglar climbs in, it would be absurd to say, "Ah, now he can stay, she's given him a right to the use of her house--for she is partially responsible for his presence there, having voluntarily done what enabled him to get in, in full knowledge that there are such things as burglars, and that burglars burgle.'' It would be still more absurd to say this if I had had bars installed outside my windows, precisely to prevent burglars from getting in, and a burglar got in only because of a defect in the bars

Another problem of tacit consent is that it assumes the abortion is taking place in a culture of which intercourse will result in carring a pregnancy to term. For example, societies that have a traditional restriction on the number of children a woman can have, or that are against children created outside of marriage or between members of different races or classes.

The issue is that a person's action cannot fairly be interpreted as proof of tacitly consenting to anything unless it occurs in a setting where such agreement is commonly accepted.

## Responsibility

Micheal Tooley argues that the violinist argument is undermined by considering a case in which you engage in a pleasurable activity knowing that it may have the unfortunate side effect of destroying someone’s food supply, therefore you owe it to said person even if it causes some considerable amount of suffering to yourself. This seems to make sense on the face of it, we hold drunk drivers responsible for manslaughter if an accident occurs, even if they did not intend to kill before being intoxicated. But in the case of negligent driving, there already is an agreement that people have a right not to be run over by cars, so we hold people accountable if they run the risk of violating this right. It’s agreed upon that people don’t deserve to have their food supply intentionally destroyed and from this we derive a right that people not negligently act in ways that risk unintentionally causing these things to occur. But in the case of an unintended pregnancy, the question is whether the fetus has a right not to be deliberately deprived of the needed support the pregnant woman is providing.

### Notes

\[^1\]: Note that this analogy is **NOT** about bodily autonomy, but rather nobody is morally required to make large sacrifices, of health, of all other interests and concerns, of all other duties and commitments, for nine years, or even for nine months, in order to keep another person alive, this argument is not applicable to say vaccines or face masks as those don’t require large sacrifices and if anything, help your health.

\[^2\]: An objection to this analogy is that it’s too “weird” or “unrealistic”, but a hypothetical being unrealistic doesn’t make it unreasonable because the purpose of a hypothetical is not to be realistic but to be a sort of vacuum situation that isolates the thing you’re talking about. If the differences do not themselves prove to be morally irrelevant, then the mere strangeness of the example in and of itself will provide no further reason for rejecting the argument’s soundness.

\[^3\]: A response to this could possibly be that a computer error like this is rare, unlike pregnancy resulting from intercourse isn’t, but the analogy could simply be tweaked as to say the chances of a computer error occuring are changed to be precisely the same as the chances of conception occurring from a single act of intercourse without contraception. It could also be tweaked so that the woman having intercourse has major fertility issues, making conception from an act of intercourse extremely unlikely in her instance, much like having a doctor perform the wrong surgery on you when you check into a hospital.
