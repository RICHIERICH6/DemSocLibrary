# Abortion Philosophical Argument

The most common pro-life position is basically:

* Premise 1: The human fetus has the right to life.
* Premise 2: If the fetus has a right to life, killing the fetus is morally impermissible.
* Conclusion: Abortion is morally impermissible.

Now whether or not you agree with Premise 1 is fine, but we as humans agree that there is not one "right to life" but a range. For example, an animal may have a lower right to life than a human  but a right to life nonetheless. To illustrate this, if you were driving on the road, and saw a sentient 4 year old child and an artificial womb with a fetus inside, and swerving the car would save the child but kill the artificial womb. Even if you agree that the fetus has the right to life, I assume you would swerve the car to save the child instead of the non sentient fetus, but I'd raise this hypothetical:

A person wakes up to discover that she has been kidnapped in the night and hooked up to an unconscious violinist whose blood must be filtered through her kidneys for a certain period if he is to survive. The director of the hospital concedes that it was wrong of the violinist’s admirers to have hooked her up to him without her consent; nevertheless, he observes, “To unplug you would be to kill him,” and “A person’s right to life outweighs your right to decide what happens in and to your body.”\[^1\]\[^2\]

## Tacit Consent

A pro-lifer could argue against this by saying that the violinist situation is coercive while the pregnancy was a result of the woman, who consented to sexual intercourse:

* Premise 1: You may have sex voluntarily which will result in a pregnancy.
* Premise 2: You tacitly consented to pregnancy because you consented to having sex, which you presumably know will result in a pregnancy.
* Conclusion: You consented to carrying the child to full term.

In which I raise this hypothetical:

You voluntarily checked into the hospital on December 31, 1999, for some optional cosmetic surgery, knowing that a Y2K-related computer error could result in you having the wrong operation done, a type of mistake you knew happens from time to time even when there are no computer difficulties. Your friends warned you against taking such risks with your body, but you disregarded their advice. After falling asleep for the evening, you awoke to find that, despite the fact that no one had done anything to you that they weren't meant to do, you had been accidentally plugged into the ailing violinist due to a computer error. In this version of the story, there is no culpable human agent who plugs you into the violinist. As in the case of the conception of the fetus resulting from voluntary intercourse, your becoming plugged into the violinist is merely the result of a random occurrence, though one that could only occur because a prior act of yours had made it possible for it to occur. But surely no one will say that because you knew that this random event might occur after you checked yourself into the hospital, your checking yourself in counts as consent to remain plugged into the violinist. And so, by parity of reasoning, we cannot say that because the woman who engaged in voluntary intercourse knew that conception might occur, her engaging in intercourse counts as consent to carry her pregnancy to term.\[^3\]

If my niece required a kidney transplant, and I donated my kidney, but before they took the kidney from me, I would revoke the donation. Should the doctors still force the kidney out of me? I consciously consented to it but then revoked my consent before it happened. Even if a woman says they 100% want to get pregnant, why shouldn’t they have the ability to change their mind the same way I can keep my kidney even if I consciously request to donate it to someone?

If the room is stuffy, and I therefore open a window to air it, and a burglar climbs in, it would be absurd to say, "Ah, now he can stay, she's given him a right to the use of her house--for she is partially responsible for his presence there, having voluntarily done what enabled him to get in, in full knowledge that there are such things as burglars, and that burglars burgle.'' It would be still more absurd to say this if I had had bars installed outside my windows, precisely to prevent burglars from getting in, and a burglar got in only because of a defect in the bars

Another problem of tacit consent is that it assumes the abortion is taking place in a culture of which intercourse will result in carrying a pregnancy to term. For example, societies that have a traditional restriction on the number of children a woman can have, or that are against children created outside of marriage or between members of different races or classes.

The issue is that a person's action cannot fairly be interpreted as proof of tacitly consenting to anything unless it occurs in a setting where such agreement is commonly accepted.

## Responsibility

Micheal Tooley argues that the violinist argument is undermined by considering a case in which you engage in a pleasurable activity knowing that it may have the unfortunate side effect of destroying someone’s food supply, therefore you owe it to said person even if it causes some considerable amount of suffering to yourself. Basically, if we were to apply it to a pregnancy:

* Premise 1: You are responsible for the fact that the other person now exists. 
* Premise 2: You are responsible for the fact that, given that the other person now exists, he stands in need of your assistance
* Conclusion: Therefore, you owe your help to said person even if it is causes some considerable amount of suffering to yourself.

In which I raise this hypothetical:

You are the violinist’s doctor. Seven years ago, you discovered that the violinist had contracted a rare disease that was on the verge of killing him. The only way to save his life that was available to you was to give him a drug that cures the disease but has one unfortunate side effect: Five to ten years after ingestion, it often causes his kidney disease. Knowing that you alone would have the appropriate blood type to save the violinist were his kidneys to fail, you prescribed the drug and cured the disease. The violinist has now been struck by the kidney ailment. If you do not allow him the use of your kidneys for nine months, he will die.

You did a voluntary action such that had you not done it, the violinist would not now exist. If you had not given him the drug, he would not now exist. A woman whose pregnancy is the result of voluntary intercourse, that is, is responsible for the existence of the fetus, but is not responsible for the neediness of the fetus, given that it exists.

## Killing versus Letting Die

 A response to the violinist argument could be:

* Premise 1: In the violinist argument, you are unplugging yourself, you're not killing them but merely allowing them to die.
* Premise 2: in abortion, you are killing the fetus as you have to either kill it or remove it to complete said abortion.
* Conclusion: Unplugging yourself from the violinist would be permissible as it's just unplugging yourself, but since an abortion requires that you directly kill the fetus, it is not a valid analogy.

The problem that comes with this conclusion is that abortions don't necessarily have to directly kill the fetus, but just let them die. A Hysterotomy abortion involves removing the living fetus through an abdominal incision of the uterus and then allowing it to die, sure she would never be able to have children  ever again, but removing the uterus would be like unplugging yourself from the violinist.\[^4\]

Unplugging yourself results in the violinist’s death only because his condition is such that he cannot survive on his own, and thus the act that originates the fatal sequence that you allow to continue is whatever act led to its being the case that the violinist had this condition. Let us suppose that the fetus dies after it has been removed because its lungs are insufficiently developed to breathe on its own. Then whatever caused the fetus to have such poorly developed lungs at this point in time is what initiated the fatal sequence. And since it is presumably part of the normal course of things that a fetus at an early stage of gestation has lungs of this level of development, the act which causally led to this state of affairs was simply the act of conceiving it in the first place. This means that removing the fetus from the womb does not initiate the fatal sequence of events but merely allows the death to occur, which would have occurred in any event once conception had occurred if the woman had not been sheltering the fetus.

One might respond to this by saying there never was an already existing fatal sequence in the case of the fetus but that there was an already existing fatal sequence in the case of the violinist. And this would imply that removing the fetus does initiate the fatal sequence of events in the case of hysterotomy while  
unplugging yourself from the violinist does not. In which I raise this hypothetical:

You wake up in the morning and discover that last night some randos kidnapped you and plugged you into a perfectly healthy violinist. In the middle of the night, though, his kidneys unexpectedly failed as a result of a predisposition to such failure that he inherited genetically. As a result, you must remain plugged into him for nine months or he will die.

There was never a time when the violinist was in danger of dying before he was plugged into you, just as there was never a time when the fetus was in danger of dying before it was in the womb. If you unplug yourself in this case, I'm inclined to say you're simply allowing the events to happen.



### Notes

* \[^1\]: Note that this analogy is **NOT** about bodily autonomy, but rather nobody is morally required to make large sacrifices, of health, of all other interests and concerns, of all other duties and commitments, for nine years, or even for nine months, in order to keep another person alive, this argument is not applicable to say vaccines or face masks as those don’t require large sacrifices and if anything, help your health.
* \[^2\]: An objection to this analogy is that it’s too “weird” or “unrealistic”, but a hypothetical being unrealistic doesn’t make it unreasonable because the purpose of a hypothetical is not to be realistic but to be a sort of vacuum situation that isolates the thing you’re talking about. If the differences do not themselves prove to be morally irrelevant, then the mere strangeness of the example in and of itself will provide no further reason for rejecting the argument’s soundness.
* \[^3\]: A response to this could possibly be that a computer error like this is rare, unlike pregnancy resulting from intercourse isn’t, but the analogy could simply be tweaked as to say the chances of a computer error occuring are changed to be precisely the same as the chances of conception occurring from a single act of intercourse without contraception. It could also be tweaked so that the woman having intercourse has major fertility issues, making conception from an act of intercourse extremely unlikely in her instance, much like having a doctor perform the wrong surgery on you when you check into a hospital.
* \[^4\]: One could object to the characterization of a procedure such as hysterotomy as an instance of letting die rather than killing. One might argue that since removing the fetus from the uterus \(or the fetus and the uterus from the woman\) actively deprives the fetus of the support it needs in order to survive, the remover causes the death and does not merely allow it to happen. But if we are to characterize hysterotomy as killing on these grounds, then by parity of reasoning we will also have to say that unplugging yourself from the violinst kills him and does not merely let him die, since it is equally true that unplugging yourself from him actively disconnects the violinist from the support that he needs in order to survive.
