# Veganism

## Formal Argument

* Premise 1: Humans have non-trivial moral status just in case and because they have a certain trait.
* Premise 2: If humans have non-trivial moral status just in case and because they have a certain trait, then all beings have non-trivial moral status just in case and because they have that trait.
* Premise 3: Sentient animals have the trait that gives non-trivial moral status to humans.
* Conclusion: Therefore, Sentient animals have non-trivial moral status 

## Meat is Necessary in a Diet

No, just no. \[^1\]

## Eating Meat Is Okay Because It's Natural

This is just fallacious reasoning. Something being “natural” doesn’t mean it’s good, and there’s also the problem of “what does natural even mean?”

## Animals Eat Each Other

Not all animals eat each other, many animals in fact are herbivores.  The major problem with this though is that animal behavior does not excuse our own, the fact that an infant vomits and poops all over itself doesn't mean it's okay for you to do so for others. Animals do all sorts of things to each other \(and to us\), including eating each other. Does this make it okay for us to do the same thing?

## Moral Agency

The most common trait used to respond to the formal argument would be the idea that animals do not have the ability to make moral judgements, so they do not deserve moral consideration. The problem is that certain animals \(elephants, whales, primates\) do infact show some levels of empathy or moral agency, similar to that of humans. Another problem is “well why does moral agency define moral value?”

If we in fact agree that only moral agents deserve moral consideration? What’s preventing us from killing babies or extremely mentally disabled people? What’s preventing us from doing so is because they are sentient and can feel so we give them moral consideration.

## Intelligence

Similar to the above trait, this argues that animals are of significantly lower intelligence. This is probably the worst trait named because it is so easily applicable to humans. Once again, what’s preventing us from killing babies or extremely mentally disabled people? What would be immoral about super intelligent robots or aliens killing humans?

## Divine Command Theory

This argues that since god dictates morality, and god allows us to kill animals, killing animals is morally acceptable. This goes into more about metaethics overall rather than veganism, so I will just summarize the problems with divine command theory:

* You'd have to establish that god even exists which is a whole other can of worms.
* If there are no moral standard other than God's will, then God's commands are arbitrary, which would mean morality isn't based off reason.

## No Ethical Consumption under Capitalism

The argument essentially removes the role of individual responsibility from a person who refuses to be vegan just because capitalism may be unethical. This is simply a nirvana fallacy, just because it may be impossible to avoid all wrongdoing doesn’t mean we don’t try to lessen harm. If I live in a society where slavery is allowed, it would still be immoral for me to buy a slave.
