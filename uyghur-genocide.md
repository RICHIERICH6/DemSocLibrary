## The 2017 Xinjiang De-extremiﬁcation Regulations

Here's a quick list of behaviors explicitly or implicitly banned by these regulations, translated thanks to [China Law Translate](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/decision-to-revise-the-xinjiang-uighur-autonomous-region-regulation-on-de-extremification/):

* Growing your beard too long \("irregular"\)
* Wearing niqāb of your own accord
* Naming your child with an Arabic name
* Sharing any content the state, through its extremely broad and vague definition of extremism, finds objectionable
* Saying something interpreted by the state as extremist to others
* Protesting any of these policies you find objectionable

A month after the publication of these regulations, the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/world/asia/china-xinjiang-ban-muslim-names-muhammad-jihad.html) claims to have received a copy of a list of "abnormal names" from unspecified Uyghur activist groups. The article says banned names including Mohammed, Arafat, Jihad, Mujahid, and Medina.
