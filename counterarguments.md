# Counterarguments

### Transgender

### Claim: "This [study](https://0x0.la/u/ZoH9GyV.pdf) in Sweden proves transitioning increases trans suicide!"

No, this isn't what the study claims. Here's an excerpt:

> no inferences can be drawn as to the effectiveness of sex reassignment as a treatment for transsexualism. In other words, the\*\* results should not be interpreted such as sex reassignment per se increases morbidity and mortality\*\*. Things might have been even worse without sex reassignment.

The study is just saying that people who had transitioned are still a endangered population compared to cis people, not that transitioning worsened suicide.

The author clarified this in an [AMA](https://archive.is/z6faD#selection-1977.142-1977.213).

## aren't Pedophiles

### Claim: "The [FRC ](https://web.archive.org/web/20050211233643/http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=IS02E3)proved homosexuals are pedos!"

They misrepresent research, to [quote ](https://0x0.la/u/P2jYp76.pdf#page=9)Gregory Herek:

> In summary, the scientific sources cited by the FRC report **do not support their argument**. **Most of the studies they referenced did not even assess the sexual orientation of abusers**. Two studies **explicitly concluded that sexual orientation and child molestation are unrelated**. Notably, the FRC f**ailed to cite the 1978 study by Groth and Birnbaum, which also contradicted their argument**. Only one study (Erickson et al., 1988) might be interpreted as supporting the FRC argument, **and it failed to detail its measurement procedures and did not differentiate bisexual from homosexual offenders**.

### Claim: "This study by Cameron proves homosexuals are pedos!"

Cameron's survey data are subject to so many methodological flaws as to be virtually meaningless, to [quote ](https://0x0.la/u/KP9kriX.html)Gregory Herek:

> Cameron group's sampling techniques,survey methodology, and interpretation of results\*\* reveals atleast six serious errors in their study\*\*. The presence of even one of these flaws would be sufficient to cast serious doubts on the legitimacy of any study's results. In combination, **they make thedata virtually meaningless**.

Cameron is also just a [shitty person](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_cameron.html).
