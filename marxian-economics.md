## Labor Theory of Value

* Under certain assumptions, a general equilibrium occurs, general equilibrium theory uses both supply-side and demand-side, **this is in direct opposition to the LTV which is purely supply-side**. \([Econometrica](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~shmuel/AAT-readings/Econ%20segment/Arrow-DeBreu.pdf#page=9)\)
* Price deviations are highly persistent, a phenomena **not explainable by the LTV**. \([Structural Change and Economic Dynamics](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/fileadmin/Dateiverwaltung/IfW-Publications/Andrea_Vaona/price-price-deviations-are-highly-persistent/paper.pdf)\)
* **No empirical support** for cost price correlations with data from 10 OECD countries. \([Empirical Economics](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/fileadmin/Dateiverwaltung/IfW-Publications/Andrea_Vaona/a-panel-data-approach-to-price-value-correlations/Vaona_paneldata.pdf)\)

## Tendency of the rate of profit to fall

There is mixed literature on whether the rate of profit is falling, whether or not the rate of profit is falling doesn't really matter though. The conclusion that capitalist production could not be an everlasting form of production due to the rate of profit to fall doesn't hold up when we look at [economic stability under capitalism](general/capitalism.md#stability).
