# Homosexuals aren't Pedophiles

* Age and sex preferences **develop independently**. ([Archives of Sexual Behavior](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/sites/webpublish.queensu.ca.psycwww/files/files/Faculty/Vern%20Qunisey/Silverthorne_Quinsey-2000.pdf))
* The data **do not support a finding that homosexual identity and/or preordination same-sex sexual behavior are significant risk factors for the sexual abuse of minors**. ([United States Conference of Catholic Bishops  ](https://www.bishop-accountability.org/reports/2011\_05\_18\_John_Jay_Causes_and_Context_Report.pdf))
* This literature review **does not show that gay or bisexual men are any more likely than heterosexual men to molest children**. ([Gregory Herek](https://0x0.la/u/yFDsbPe.html))
* **90%** of child molesters **target children in their network of family and friends, and the majority are men married to women**. ([Child Molestation Research & Prevention Institute](https://www.cmrpi.org/pages/tell_others_the_facts.html))
* The distinction between homosexual and heterosexual child molesters** relies on the premise that male molesters of male victims are homosexual in orientation**. Most molesters of boys **do not report sexual interest in adult men, however**. ([The National Academies Press](https://0x0.la/u/VYUOLUV.pdf#page=158))
* Homosexual adults are **no more likely than heterosexuals to abuse children**. ([Harvard Health Publishing](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429130147/https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/pessimism-about-pedophilia))
* More than **70 percent of the men who molest boys rate themselves as heterosexual in their adult sexual preferences**. In addition, 9 percent report that they are equally heterosexual and homosexual. **Only 8 percent report that they are exclusively homosexual**. ([Myra L Hidalgo](https://rb.gy/emzzid))
* A review of 352 medical charts of molestation cases for one year in a Denver childrenâ€™s hospital, **less than 1% of the molesters could be identified as gay or lesbian**. ([Pediatrics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8008535/))
* In 269 cases of child molestation,** two offenders were identified as being gay or lesbian**. ([Pediatrics](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/94/1/41))
* Gay males were **no more sexually aroused by pictures of young boys than straight males were aroused by pictures of young girls**. ([Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology](https://dacemirror.sci-hub.st/journal-article/818283806aa95fb243b9a1badbbaebc0/freund1989.pdf))
*  The adult heterosexual male **constitutes a greater risk to the underage child than does the adult homosexual male**. ([Archives of Sexual Behavior](https://zero.sci-hub.se/650/86b797f086fe846a581e52716b2cda0c/groth1978.pdf))
* Ironically, stigmatisation of homosexuality is **likely inhibitory to attempts to prevent child molestation**. ([Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry](https://sci-hub.st/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb00862.x))

## Counteraguments

### Claim: "The [FRC ](https://web.archive.org/web/20050211233643/http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=IS02E3)proved homosexuals are pedos!"

They misrepresent research, to [quote ](https://0x0.la/u/P2jYp76.pdf#page=9)Gregory Herek:

> In summary, the scientific sources cited by the FRC report **do not support their argument**. **Most of the studies they referenced did not even assess the sexual orientation of abusers**. Two studies **explicitly concluded that sexual orientation and child molestation are unrelated**. Notably, the FRC f**ailed to cite the 1978 study by Groth and Birnbaum, which also contradicted their argument**. Only one study (Erickson et al., 1988) might be interpreted as supporting the FRC argument, **and it failed to detail its measurement procedures and did not differentiate bisexual from homosexual offenders**.

### Claim: "This study by Cameron proves homosexuals are pedos!"

Cameron's survey data are subject to so many methodological flaws as to be virtually meaningless, to [quote ](https://0x0.la/u/KP9kriX.html)Gregory Herek: 

> Cameron group's sampling techniques,survey methodology, and interpretation of results** reveals atleast six serious errors in their study**. The presence of even one of these flaws would be sufficient to cast serious doubts on the legitimacy of any study's results. In combination, **they make thedata virtually meaningless**.

Cameron is also just a [shitty person](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_cameron.html).
