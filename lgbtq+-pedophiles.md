# LGBTQ+ aren't Pedophiles

* The empirical research **does not show that gay or bisexual men are any more likely than heterosexual men to molest children**. \([Gregory Herek](https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html)\)
* The distinction between homosexual and heterosexual child molesters **relies on the premise that male molesters of male victims are homosexual in orientation**. Most molesters of boys **do not report sexual interest in adult men, however**. \([The National Academies Press](https://0x0.la/u/VYUOLUV.pdf#page=158)\)
* * Homosexual adults are **no more likely than heterosexuals to abuse children**. \([Harvard Health Publishing](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429130147/https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/pessimism-about-pedophilia)\)
* More than **70 percent of the men who molest boys rate themselves as heterosexual in their adult sexual preferences**. In addition, 9 percent report that they are equally heterosexual and homosexual. **Only 8 percent report that they are exclusively homosexual**. \([Myra L Hidalgo](https://rb.gy/emzzid)\)
* A review of 352 medical charts of molestation cases for one year in a Denver childrenâ€™s hospital, **less than 1% of the molesters could be identified as gay or lesbian**. \([Pediatrics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8008535/)\)
* Gay males were **no more sexually aroused by pictures of young boys than straight males were aroused by pictures of young girls**. \([Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology](https://dacemirror.sci-hub.st/journal-article/818283806aa95fb243b9a1badbbaebc0/freund1989.pdf)\)
*  The adult heterosexual male **constitutes a greater risk to the underage child than does the adult homosexual male**. \([Archives of Sexual Behavior](https://zero.sci-hub.se/650/86b797f086fe846a581e52716b2cda0c/groth1978.pdf)\)
