# Homosexuals aren't Child Molesters

* Age and sex preferences **develop independently**. ([Archives of Sexual Behavior](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.500.1739\&rep=rep1\&type=pdf))
* The data **do not support a finding that homosexual identity and/or preordination same-sex sexual behavior are significant risk factors for the sexual abuse of minors**. ([United States Conference of Catholic Bishops  ](https://www.bishop-accountability.org/reports/2011\_05\_18\_John\_Jay\_Causes\_and\_Context\_Report.pdf))

It is worth point out that this study concludes that "the current crisis cannot be addressed without consideration of issues related to homosexuality.", but they only come to this conclusion through the fact that most of the victims were boys, this **however doesn't prove anything**. The sex of the victims of child molestation **does not necessarily indicate whether the perpetrator possesses a heterosexual or a homosexual sexual orientation or even if they possess one at all**. One of the researchers of the report [said as much](https://archive.md/KLT3i#selection-1177.1-1181.559).

* **90%** of child molesters **target children in their network of family and friends, and the majority are men married to women**. ([Child Molestation Research & Prevention Institute](https://www.cmrpi.org/pages/tell\_others\_the\_facts.html))
* The distinction between homosexual and heterosexual child molesters** relies on the premise that male molesters of male victims are homosexual in orientation**. Most molesters of boys **do not report sexual interest in adult men, however**. ([The National Academies Press](https://0x0.la/u/VYUOLUV.pdf#page=158))
* Homosexual adults are **no more likely than heterosexuals to abuse children**. ([Harvard Health Publishing](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429130147/https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter\_article/pessimism-about-pedophilia))
* More than **70 percent of the men who molest boys rate themselves as heterosexual in their adult sexual preferences**. In addition, 9 percent report that they are equally heterosexual and homosexual. **Only 8 percent report that they are exclusively homosexual**. ([Myra L Hidalgo](https://rb.gy/emzzid))
* A review of 352 medical charts of molestation cases for one year in a Denver childrenâ€™s hospital, **less than 1% of the molesters could be identified as gay or lesbian**. ([Pediatrics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8008535/))
* In 269 cases of child molestation,** two offenders were identified as being gay or lesbian**. ([Pediatrics](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/94/1/41))
* Gay males were **no more sexually aroused by pictures of young boys than straight males were aroused by pictures of young girls**. ([Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology](https://dacemirror.sci-hub.st/journal-article/818283806aa95fb243b9a1badbbaebc0/freund1989.pdf))
* Homosexual males who preferred physically mature partners** responded no more to male children than heterosexual males who preferred physically mature partners responded to female children**. ([Journal of Sex Research](http://www.robinjwilson.com/articles/freund%201989%20erotic%20age%20pref.pdf))
* The adult heterosexual male **constitutes a greater risk to the underage child than does the adult homosexual male**. ([Archives of Sexual Behavior](https://zero.sci-hub.se/650/86b797f086fe846a581e52716b2cda0c/groth1978.pdf))
* &#x20;21 adult sex offenders against boys **found that two thirds of them had a sexual preference for women over men. **([Behaviour Research and Therapy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/000579678890071X?via%3Dihub))
* Intense sexual attraction to male children is **distinct from, and not generally compatible with, intense sexual attraction to men**. ([Journal of Abnormal Psychology](https://sci-hub.st/10.1037/abn0000212))
* Ironically, stigmatisation of homosexuality is **likely inhibitory to attempts to prevent child molestation**. ([Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry](https://sci-hub.st/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb00862.x))
