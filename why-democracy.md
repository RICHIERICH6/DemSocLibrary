# Democracy

## Efficacy

* Democracy **is rising**. ([Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/numbers-of-autocracies-and-democracies?country=\~OWID\_WRL))
* Democracy is **correlated with less child mortality**. ([Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy#people-in-democracies-are-healthier))
* Democracy is **correlated with better human rights**. ([Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy#democracies-are-better-at-protecting-human-rights))
* Democracies **don't kill their own citizens as much as authoritarian or totalitarian countries**. ([Journal of Conflict Resolution](https://0x0.la/u/DTmJL7u.pdf#page=16))
* Democracies **are less warlike than other regimes**. ([University of Hawaii](https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/DP95.HTM))
* Democracies **are much more stable politically.** ([International Social Science Review](https://digitalcommons.northgeorgia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070\&context=issr))
* Robust empirical correlation **between well-functioning democratic institutions and the strong protection of core liberal rights, such as rights to a fair trial, bodily integrity, freedom of association, and freedom of expression**. ([Gerald Gaus](https://files.catbox.moe/o1rodp.pdf#page=232)) ([Thomas Christiano](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1111/j.1088-4963.2011.01204.x)  )
* Democracy has **great epistemic merits**, in any of its many forms due to the Condorcet's Jury theorem. ([List and Goodin](https://philpapers.org/archive/LISEDG.pdf))

## Economy

* There is a **positive and statistically significant impact of economic freedom and democracy on macroeconomic stability**. ([Problems and Perspectives in Management](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/231765996.pdf))
*  Both capitalism and democracy **appear to decrease emissions levels per dollar value of GDP**. ([Michael D. Stroup](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.527.5649\&rep=rep1\&type=pdf))  \

* Democracy is **correlated with GDP per capita, except for fossil fuel exporters**. ([Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy#democratic-countries-are-richer-the-exception-are-fossil-fuel-exporters))
* Democracy **increases future GDP by encouraging investment, increasing schooling, inducing economic reforms, improving public good provision, and reducing social unrest**. ([Journal of Political Economy](https://sci-hub.se/downloads/2020-09-03/c0/acemoglu2018.pdf))
* Autocrats **were either damaging or inconsequential for the economy of their countries**. ([The Leadership Quarterly](http://sci-hub.se/downloads/2019-11-19/b8/rizio2019.pdf))
