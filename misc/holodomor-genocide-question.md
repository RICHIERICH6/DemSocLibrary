# Holodomor Genocide Question

* The Holodomor is **internationally recognized as a genocide**. \([Holodomor Museum](https://holodomormuseum.org.ua/en/recognition-of-holodomor-as-genocide-in-the-world/)\)
* There is **no doubt that Stalin and his supporters indeed did not help the starving and instead allowed them to die**. \([Europe-Asia Studies](https://0x0.la/u/I8x02pA.pdf#page=4)\)
* It is therefore **justified to claim that the Soviet authorities used the famine as an instrument of a repression campaign designed to break the resistance of the Ukrainian rural population against communism, and to refer to the repressions as a crime against humanity**. \([Tadeusz A. Olszański](https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/96497/commentary_16.pdf)\)
* These findings **do not, of course, free Stalin from responsibility for the famine**. \([Slavic Review](https://0x0.la/u/7gFygho.pdf#page=17)\)

The idea that the 1930s famine were a man-made event caused by Soviet policies is beyond dispute. The current debate is centred around largely the semantic use of “genocide” as well as the form of intent.
