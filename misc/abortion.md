# Most Abortions Aren't Wrong

## Formal Argument

* Premise 1: Sentient beings are at the center of moral concern.
* Premise 2: Fetuses aren't sentient [until 12 to 30 weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal\_perception#Prenatal\_pain).
* Premise 3: Most abortions [occur before fetuses gain sentience](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/factsheet/fb\_induced\_abortion.pdf#page=2) (about 80.1% to 98.7%).
* Conclusion: Therefore, most abortions are morally permissible.

I'll just defend the first premise, as the second and third premise are empirically proven and the conclusion naturally follows.

Concerns about sentience and feeling in fetuses are most important for them because they are fundamentally what’s most important for us. Sentience enables us to have and experience anything good in life, and it is necessary for anything bad to happen to us also: without a point of view, things can’t get worse for us.

Imagine that someone was born unsentient and lived their entire existence without sentience: they were never aware of anything, ever. They had no perceptions, no awareness, no feelings, and of course no relationships, knowledge, happiness, or even sadness. And then they died. What were they like? Honestly, they never were: there was never anyone there. If anything bad ever happened to this body, nothing bad ever happened to them, since “they” never existed in a way that matters.&#x20;

Consider also if you died prematurely, or were killed, or even if you went into a permanent coma or vegetative state, perhaps for many years or decades, and then died. Either option is very bad for you: since your sentience ends, you end.

Rocks aren’t sentient, plants aren’t sentient, and that’s why they lack rights. Minds matter, and so the fact that embryos and early fetuses completely lack minds—due initially to the absence of a brain and nervous system, and later due to these not being sufficiently developed to support sentience—is what’s morally significant, not whether fetuses have heartbeats, or can move, or even respond to stimuli, if those responses aren’t genuinely felt by the fetus.

## Counter Arguments

### Deprivation Argument

[Don Marquis](https://philosophy.ku.edu/donald-marquis) in his paper "[Why Abortion Is Immoral](https://courses.edx.org/c4x/GeorgetownX/phlx101-01/asset/marquis.pdf)” not only challenges pro-abortion philosophy but why we consider murder to be wrong. In which he argues that killing someone is wrong because it deprives the embryo of a valuable future. Marquis begins by arguing that what makes it wrong to kill a normal adult human being is the fact that the killing inflicts a terrible harm on the victim. The harm consists in the fact that "when I die, I am deprived of all of the value of my future"

My first problem with the “deprivation argument” is that depriving someone of a valuable future isn’t limited to abortion or even murder. Imagine person A and B are in a race for a very valuable trophy that will lead them to a valuable future of glory and fame if they win, but if they lose they are disqualified from ever participating in any sport ever leading them to a deprivation of a valuable future in sports. Would it be wrong for either person A or B to win the race and deprive the other person a valuable future in sports?\
\
If deprivation of potentially valuable futures is presumed to be a sort of responsible homicide, then culpable homicide occurs whenever a person is refused access to what he or she requires to survive. Homicide victims include a homeless guy who dies from exposure and an injured infant who dies due to a lack of a sufficient blood transfusion.\
\
I would also say that a being can be seriously harmed by being deprived of a valuable future only if there are sufficient psychological connections and depriving a fetus of its future does not seriously harm it, unlike a sentient being with desires.

### &#xD;&#xD;Potentiality Argument

If fetuses aren’t sentient, they are at least potential sentient beings, meaning they could and would become sentient beings. This is true. This, however, doesn’t mean that they currently have the rights of sentient beings because, in general, _potential things of a kind don’t have the rights of actual things of that kind_: potential doctors, lawyers, judges, presidents, voters, veterans, adults, parents, spouses, graduates, moral reasoners and more don’t have the rights of actual individuals of those kinds.

The beginnings of something are usually not that thing: a pile of lumber and supplies is not a house; fabric, buttons and thread are not a shirt, and an embryo or early fetus is not a baby or child.

* Premise 1: X's moral value is equal to X's potential.&#x20;
* Premise 2: Sperm have the potential to become babies.&#x20;
* Conclusion: Sperm have moral value equal to that of babies.

or

* Premise 1: X's rights are equal to X's potential to have those rights.
* Premise 2: Children have the potential to become adults.
* Conclusion: Children have rights equal to that of adults.

Pretty silly!

### Unconsciousness Argument

A common reductio response to the sentiocentric approach would be: "if it is the case that it is not unethical to kill an unsentient fetus, would it be morally acceptable to comatose people?"

This argument is superficially appealing, but the comparison doesn’t hold up. A sleeping person has desires and interests just like we do, and therefore they can be harmed when those desires and interests are thwarted. Of course, when you are asleep, you aren’t consciously holding any desires in your attention. But this is also true of most of your desires even when you are awake. If you love your children, you don’t stop loving them the moment you focus your attention on something else, like a football game. Likewise, you may not be thinking, as you read this “I don’t want to be killed” or “I value my car.” Yet it would still be wrong to kill you or steal your car.&#x20;

These long term desires are known as "dispositional desires". You have dispositional desires even when you aren’t consciously focused on them, including when you are unconscious or asleep. Those dispositional desires only go away when you die or when your brain is irrevocably destroyed. But for you or any other entity to have dispositional desires, you must first have some initial first person conscious experience. A being that has never experienced desire of any kind can’t have long term desires.&#x20;
