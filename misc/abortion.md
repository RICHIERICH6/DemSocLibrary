# Abortion Philosophical Argument

## Formal Argument

### Pro-Life Argument

This is the most popular pro-life argument from what I've seen:

* Premise 1: The killing of human life forms is prohibited.
* Premise 2: A fetus is a human life form.
* Conclusion: The killing of a fetus is prohibited.

The problem is the first premise, which presupposes that because you are human you inherently have some right to life. This commits a [is-ought fallacy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#io), that because we are biologically human (is), we (ought) have a right to life. You'd have to give some line of reasoning as to WHY being biologically human gives you some right to life. I reject this and instead argue that sentience is what matters.

### What is Sentience?

Sentience is the ability to feel, perceive and experience subjectively, it allows for the awareness of one's own surroundings (consciousness) and the subjective interpretation of such, although not all sentient beings are conscious at all times (unconsciousness).

### Why does sentience matter?

One might say that for something to be alive, they have to fit the criteria for a “living being”, plants, cells, etc are living beings but, we wouldn’t ascribe them with moral status. Why is that? Simple, because they are functionally “dead”. To determine whether something is right or wrong, the actions have to be looked at, and depending on your moral persuasion, the consequences and the amount of suffering brought by those actions.

Sentience is the line of whether something is aware and perceives, has free will with desires and wants. Therefore, without sentience, nothing would matter just because no one would be there to see it. If there was a universe composed of multiple galaxies that were just wiped out, but there would be no sentient beings, why would this matter? There would be no suffering, no sight of it, no amount of destruction to the universe would amount to anything except a spectacle with no audience.

We don’t worry about the cells on our skin that we scratch or the grass we step on or the bacteria in our armpits, well why would we? Just because they’re biologically alive doesn’t mean we care about them.

### What does it have to do with a fetus?

If  plants aren’t sentient and that's why they lack rights, then it would reason that since embryos and early fetuses completely lack sentience (as they don’t have a central nervous system), they lack rights. Minds matter, not the heart or any cells in your body.

Imagine that someone was born unsentient and lived their entire life without sentience, they never had perceptions or feelings, no awareness, no happiness, and no sadness. What was this person? There never was a person, it just an empty husk. Nothing bad could ever happen to this person since they never really existed.\


## Counter Arguments

### Golden Rule

“How would you like it if you were aborted?” essentially.

This is pretty silly, considering any amount of actions could easily prevent a birth other than an abortion. What if my would-be father got a vasectomy, or my mother and father never met, or my mother decided to be celibate? The hypothetical fetus wouldn’t be here to answer the question, someone else would be. If I were aborted, nobody would be depriving me of anything because I never existed.

### Potentiality

This reasons that since fetuses are potential persons, they deserve moral consideration. This however does not reason that they have the rights of an existing person because we don't grant rights that way. Potential doctors, presidents, veterans, adults, graduates, judges, etc don’t have the rights of actual doctors, presidents, veterans, adults, graduates, and judges.

A similar argument to this is from Don Marquis’s paper “Why Abortion is Immoral”. He argues that it is wrong to kill existing people, because it deprives us from experiencing our (expected to be) valuable futures which would be a loss to said person dying. Since fetuses have valuable futures like us, they are also wrong to kill. The problem is that fetuses don’t have the same “future like our future”, they aren’t sentient beings so they are psychologically disconnected from any possible future experiences. Children and adults (and arguably babies) are aware of the current moment which leads to the next, thinking about their future, but fetuses can do no such thing.

The issue is that contraception, even abstinence, prevents that thing's future value from materializing, and thus appears to be incorrect when we apply Marquis' reasoning. Because contraception is not always wrong, but his general premise implies that it is, it appears that preventing something from experiencing its valuable future isn't always wrong, and thus Marquis' argument appears to be flawed.

### Sleeping Person

A common argument against this (even Ben Shapiro used it) is that if we're allowed to kill non sentient beings, would it be okay for me to kill a sleeping person? The problem is that a sleeping person is [still conscious to some degree](https://www.sciencealert.com/your-consciousness-does-not-switch-off-during-a-dreamless-sleep-say-scientists) (even dreamless sleep). 

Someone could respond with "well what about a comatose person?", but there is a major morally relevant distinction between someone regaining their life/sentience and someone who never had life/sentience to begin with. The comatose person existed as a conscious being and so any and all of their desires, plans, expectations, hopes, and connections are thwarted if they are killed, which is bad for them (and usually others too). Beings that have never been conscious don't have any of that and so things cannot go worse for them, since there really is no "them" yet, since there is no person who experiences anything, and so there's no person that things could take a turn for the worse for.
