# Abortion

## Formal Argument

* Premise 1: Sentient beings are at the concern of moral concern.
* Premise 2: Fetuses aren't sentient [until 12 to 30 weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal\_perception#Prenatal\_pain).
* Premise 3: Most abortions [occur before fetuses gain sentience](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/factsheet/fb\_induced\_abortion.pdf#page=2).
* Conclusion: Therefore, most abortions are morally permissible.

I'll just defend the first premise, as the second and third premise are empirically proven.

Morality is a social phenomenon, this isn’t saying that it’s subjective, just that we as people use  ethics in our daily lives to determine whether to do something or not. Morality is defined by  “principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior.”  Notice the word “behavior”, how could one possibly have good and bad behavior if there were no sentient beings? How could one even judge the behavior if one isn’t sentient? Moral evaluation requires consideration of preferences about the state of the universe, but to even consider that,  you’d have to have preferences which in turn requires consciousness.

Imagine that someone was born without sentience and lived their entire existence unsentient, they never had perceptions or feelings, no awareness, no happiness, and no sadness. What was this person? There never was a person, it was just an empty husk. Nothing bad could ever happen to this person since they never really existed.

If there was a universe composed of multiple galaxies that were just wiped out, but there would be no sentient beings, why would this matter? There would be no suffering, no sight of it, no amount of destruction to the universe would amount to anything except a spectacle with no audience.\

We don’t worry about the cells on our skin that we scratch or the grass we step on or the bacteria in our armpits, well why would we? Just because they’re biologically alive doesn’t mean we care about them.&#x20;

## Counter Arguments

### Deprivation Argument

Don Marquis in his paper "[Why Abortion Is Immoral](https://courses.edx.org/c4x/GeorgetownX/phlx101-01/asset/marquis.pdf)” not only challenges pro-abortion philosophy but why we consider murder to be wrong. In which he argues that killing someone is wrong because it deprives the embryo of a valuable future. Marquis begins by arguing that what makes it wrong to kill a normal adult human being is the fact that the killing inflicts a terrible harm on the victim. The harm consists in the fact that "when I die, I am deprived of all of the value of my future"\


My first problem with the “deprivation argument” is that depriving someone of a valuable future isn’t limited to abortion or even murder. Imagine person A and B are in a race for a very valuable trophy that will lead them to a valuable future of glory and fame if they win, but if they lose they are disqualified from ever participating in any sport ever leading them to a deprivation of a valuable future in sports. Would it be wrong for either person A or B to win the race and deprive the other person a valuable future in sports?\
\
If deprivation of potentially valuable futures is presumed to be a sort of responsible homicide, then culpable homicide occurs whenever a person is refused access to what he or she requires to survive. Homicide victims include a homeless guy who dies from exposure and an injured infant who dies due to a lack of a sufficient blood transfusion.\
\
I would also say that a being can be seriously harmed by being deprived of a valuable future only if there are sufficient psychological connections and depriving a fetus of its future does not seriously harm it, unlike a sentient being with desires.\
