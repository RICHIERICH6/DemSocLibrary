# Abortion Legalization

## Safety

* Abortion is **one of the safest procedures in contemporary practice**. ([Annals Of Internal Medicine](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.3531\&rep=rep1\&type=pdf))
* The risk of death associated with childbirth is **approximately 14 times higher than that with abortion**. ([Obstetrics & Gynecology](http://unmfamilyplanning.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/119312553/Raymond%20et%20al-Comparative%20Safety.pdf))
