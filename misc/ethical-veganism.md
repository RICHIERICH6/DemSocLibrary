# Ethical Veganism

## Formal Argument

* Premise 1:  Humans have moral status just in case and because they have a certain trait.
* Premise 2: If humans have moral status just in case and because they have a certain trait, then all beings have moral status just in case and because they have that trait.
* Premise 3: Sentient non-human animals have the trait that gives moral status to humans.
* Conclusion: Sentient non-human animals have non-trivial moral status.

Basically, the question to the speciesist would be "What's true of the human that isn't true of the animal that would justify treating them in the way we do?"

## Counterarguments

### Being Human

To quote Peter Singer:

> the racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Similarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. The pattern is the same in each case.

Discrimination based off race would be similar to discrimination based off species. Reminder, that we didn't consider certain minorities "human", would it then be okay to discriminate against them?

Imagine that hyperintelligent aliens invaded Earth, would it then be morally acceptable for them to kill us? As they are a superior species in not only intelligence but technology. A decision can only be just if itâ€™s decided in an impartial manner, and if we were discriminated against as nonhuman animals are, we would find it unacceptable.
