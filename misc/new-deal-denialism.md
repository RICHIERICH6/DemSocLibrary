# New Deal Denialism

## Consensus 

* Most historians** agree that the New Deal did not serve to lengthen and deepen the Great Depression**.([The Journal of Economic History](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.482.4975\&rep=rep1\&type=pdf#page=7))

## Impact

* The New Deal had coincided with **annual rates of economic growth of 8% to 10% and unemployment was dropping**. ([Eric Raunchway](https://edgeofthewest.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/newdealfordissent.pdf))
* The New Deal had **increased consumer confidence and consumption activity**. ([Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr234.pdf)) ([Journal of Economic Literature](https://0x0.la/u/Qgk8Ipz.pdf))
* The New Deal **lowered crime and corruption**. ([Journal of Law & Economics](https://0x0.la/u/CLl0bRd.pdf)) ([NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w11080/w11080.pdf))
* A mistake associated with the New Deal was that they supported monopoly which raised profits for corporations, **while this was bad, it actually still had some.good macroeconomic effects**. ([American Economic Review](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.102.1.524))

## Pseudoscience

### Claim: "This [study ](https://sci-hub.se/10.1086/421169)proved that the New Deal cartelization policies are an important factor in accounting for the failure of the economy to return back to trend"

The problem with this study is that it bases its-self off [Real Business Cycle Theory](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/real-business-cycle-theory), which basically says that recessions are caused by a slowdown in technological process.

A) The Great Depression, however, [did not result from a slowdown in technological process](https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/19344764/Inklaar_De_Jong_Gouma\_2011\_JEH.pdf).

B) And RBCT has shown to be an [inaccurate depiction of economic fluctuations](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Temin/publication/23771925\_Real_Business_Cycle_Views_of_the_Great_Depression_and_Recent_Events_A_Review_of_Timothy_J_Kehoe_and_Edward_C_Prescott's_Great_Depressions_of_the_Twentieth_Century/links/0c96053beea5c5986b000000/Real-Business-Cycle-Views-of-the-Great-Depression-and-Recent-Events-A-Review-of-Timothy-J-Kehoe-and-Edward-C-Prescotts-Great-Depressions-of-the-Twentieth-Century.pdf).\
