# Ethical Defense Of Abortion

## Formal Argument

* Premise 1: Beings that hold preferences are at the center of moral concern.
* Premise 2: Fetuses [cannot have preferences](https://philarchive.org/archive/SIMDEH).
* Premise 3: Abortion involves the killing of beings that don't have preferences.
* Conclusion: Therefore, abortion is morally permissible.

I'll just defend the first premise with a quote from Applied Ethics by Peter Singer:

> The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a child. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because mice will suffer if they are treated in this way. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that the suffering be counted equally with the like suffering – in so far as rough comparisons can be made – of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account. This is why the limit of sentience is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others.> \

## Counter Arguments

### Deprivation Argument

[Don Marquis](https://philosophy.ku.edu/donald-marquis) in his paper "[Why Abortion Is Immoral](https://courses.edx.org/c4x/GeorgetownX/phlx101-01/asset/marquis.pdf)” not only challenges pro-abortion philosophy but why we consider murder to be wrong. In which he argues that killing someone is wrong because it deprives the embryo of a valuable future. Marquis begins by arguing that what makes it wrong to kill a normal adult human being is the fact that the killing inflicts a terrible harm on the victim. The harm consists in the fact that "when I die, I am deprived of all of the value of my future"

My first problem with the “deprivation argument” is that depriving someone of a valuable future isn’t limited to abortion or even murder. Imagine person A and B are in a race for a very valuable trophy that will lead them to a valuable future of glory and fame if they win, but if they lose they are disqualified from ever participating in any sport ever leading them to a deprivation of a valuable future in sports. Would it be wrong for either person A or B to win the race and deprive the other person a valuable future in sports?\
\
If deprivation of potentially valuable futures is presumed to be a sort of responsible homicide, then culpable homicide occurs whenever a person is refused access to what he or she requires to survive. Homicide victims include a homeless guy who dies from exposure and an injured infant who dies due to a lack of a sufficient blood transfusion.\
\
I would also say that a being can be seriously harmed by being deprived of a valuable future only if there are sufficient psychological connections and depriving a fetus of its future does not seriously harm it, unlike a sentient being with desires.

### &#xD;&#xD;Potentiality Argument

If fetuses aren’t sentient, they are at least potential sentient beings, meaning they could and would become sentient beings. This is true. This, however, doesn’t mean that they currently have the rights of sentient beings because, in general, _potential things of a kind don’t have the rights of actual things of that kind_: potential doctors, lawyers, judges, presidents, voters, veterans, adults, parents, spouses, graduates, moral reasoners and more don’t have the rights of actual individuals of those kinds.

The beginnings of something are usually not that thing: a pile of lumber and supplies is not a house; fabric, buttons and thread are not a shirt, and an embryo or early fetus is not a baby or child.

* Premise 1: X's moral value is equal to X's potential.&#x20;
* Premise 2: Sperm have the potential to become babies.&#x20;
* Conclusion: Sperm have moral value equal to that of babies.

or

* Premise 1: X's rights are equal to X's potential to have those rights.
* Premise 2: Children have the potential to become adults.
* Conclusion: Children have rights equal to that of adults.

Pretty silly!

### Unconsciousness Argument

A common reductio objection to this argument would be "if it is the case that it is permissible to kill a fetus that has no interests, would it be morally acceptable to kill comatose people who don't?"

The problem is that there is obviously a morally relevant difference between someone who has never been born who has never held preferences and someone who holds preferences but temporarily stops holding preferences.

This argument is superficially appealing, but the comparison doesn’t hold up. A sleeping person has desires and interests just like we do, and therefore they can be harmed when those desires and interests are thwarted. Of course, when you are asleep, you aren’t consciously holding any desires in your attention. But this is also true of most of your desires even when you are awake. If you love your children, you don’t stop loving them the moment you focus your attention on something else, like a football game. Likewise, you may not be thinking, as you read this “I don’t want to be killed” or “I value my car.” Yet it would still be wrong to kill you or steal your car.&#x20;

These long term desires are known as "dispositional desires". You have dispositional desires even when you aren’t consciously focused on them, including when you are unconscious or asleep. Those dispositional desires only go away when you die or when your brain is irrevocably destroyed. But for you or any other entity to have dispositional desires, you must first have some initial first person conscious experience. A being that has never experienced desire of any kind can’t have long term desires.&#x20;
