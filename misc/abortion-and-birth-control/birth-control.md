# Birth Control

* A literature review of 66 studies finds that spanning three decades, **reliable contraception allows women to be better parents**, couples who experience unintended pregnancy and unplanned childbirth **are more likely to have depression and anxiety**—while adults who plan their children **tend to be happier**, and those who are unprepared to be parents **are more likely to develop a poor relationship with their child**. \([Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/social-economic-benefits.pdf)\)
* Family planning programs of the 1960’s and 70’s were **linked with a decrease in the share of U.S. children and adults living in poverty today**. \([CESifo](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4206087/pdf/nihms602597.pdf)\)
* Contraceptive use in developing countries **has decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40%** \(about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008\) and **could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met**, Birth control **also improves child survival in the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies.** \([The Lancet](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amy-Tsui/publication/229073784_Maternal_deaths_averted_by_contraceptive_use_An_analysis_of_172_countries/links/5e9096f8a6fdcca78906b2d6/Maternal-deaths-averted-by-contraceptive-use-An-analysis-of-172-countries.pdf), [2](https://0x0.la/u/O9vmD5I.pdf)\)
* Free Birth Control Access could **reduce abortion rate by more than half**. \([Scientific American](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/free-birth-control-access-can-reduce-abortion-rate-by-more-than-half/)\)
