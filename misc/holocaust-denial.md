> Once I really am in power, **my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews**. As soon as I have the power to do so, I will have gallows built in rows — at the Marienplatz in Munich, for example — as many as traffic allows. **Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit**.** As soon as they have been untied, the next batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews. **

\-- Adolf Hitler, [1922](https://www.ifz-muenchen.de/archiv/zs/zs-0640.pdf)

> Today I will once more be a prophet. If the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the bolshevization of the earth, and this the victory of Jewry, but **the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!**

**-- **Adolf Hitler, [1939](http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/holoprelude/jewishquestion.html)

> If at the beginning of the war and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the nation had been **subjected to poison gas**, such as had to be endured in the field by hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers of all classes and professions, then the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.

\-- Adolf Hitler, [1939](https://www.historycrunch.com/mein-kampf.html#/)

> The intellectual does not have the natural means of resisting the Jewish peril because his instincts have been badly blunted. Because of this fact the nations with a high standard of civilization are exposed to this peril first and foremost. In nature life always takes measures against parasites; in the life of nations that is not always the case. From this fact the Jewish peril actually stems. **There is therefore no other recourse left for modern nations except to exterminate the Jew**…

\-- Joseph Goebbels, [1943](https://web.archive.org/web/20191230081506/http://www.nizkor.org:80/hweb/people/g/goebbels-joseph/goebbels-1948-excerpts-02.html)

> Eichmann ... told me that, according to his information, some** 6,000,000 (six million) Jews had perished until then – 4,000,000 (four million) in extermination camps and the remaining 2,000,000 (two million) through shooting by the Operations Units** and other causes, such as disease, etc.

\-- Wilhelm Höttl, [1944](https://web.archive.org/web/20040607002323/http://david-kahn.com/articles-secret-history-author-front.htm)

## Counterarguments

### Gas Chambers

#### Wooden Doors

![](<../.gitbook/assets/iQ4blnJ (1).jpeg>)

Do Holocaust deniers think wood is as brittle as cardboard? The wooden doors used in the gas chamber were airtight.

![Source](../.gitbook/assets/door1.jpe) ![Source](../.gitbook/assets/door2.jpe) ![Source](../.gitbook/assets/door3.jpe)

All the doors here were used in the delousing and gas chamber rooms are airtight.

The possibility of using wooden doors for Zyklon B delousing chambers was [described by the engineers G. Peters and E. Wüstinger of the firm Degesch (the producer of Zyklon B) in 1940](https://books.google.com/books?id=litDAAAAYAAJ\&focus=searchwithinvolume\&q=%22ausf%C3%BChrung+in+holz%22):

> The chambers should be kept as narrow as possible in order to ensure a sufficiently safe and gas-tight construction for the doors provided at both ends, also those made of wood; if possible, the doors should also have steel frames and the sealing surface (rubber profile or elastic felt strip) should rest on them. In addition to the suitability of the fumigation equipment, the tightness of these doors is of course a decisive factor for successful killing.>

For the delousing chamber in the concentration camp Flossenbürg [we have the following cost estimate from 12.04.1940](https://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=ztg\&datum=1995\&page=332\&size=45):

> Manufacture and delivery of double-walled wooden doors for gas chamber with sealing edge and closure on all sides as well as frames and thermometers incl. fittings \[...] Puttying and painting with protective paint twice of wooden doors for gas chamber, dimensions from pos. 60.&#x20;>

&#x20;This receipt [calls for an order](http://www.nizkor.com/hweb/camps/auschwitz/crematoria/order-for-door.html):

> .... order of 6/3/1943 concerning the delivery of a gas tight door 100 x 192 cm for cellar I of Krematorium III, to be produced to the identical pattern and dimensions as the cellar door of Krematorium II which is situated opposite, with peephole of double 8 mm glass, with rubber sealing strip and frame.

#### Zyklon B

The claims range from "Zyklon B can't kill! It's just used to clean lice!" to "Gas chambers don't have the blue residue that comes from Zyklon!".

This [document ](https://phdn.org/archives/holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/19420826-dessau/)of August 26, 1942, gives permission to the Auschwitz concentration camp to send a truck to Dessau, in order to pick up "material for special treatment." Special treatment [being a codeword for murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderbehandlung), with the material being [Zyklon B](http://auschwitz.org/gfx/auschwitz/\_thumbs/en/defaultgalerie/713/2/1/20080716\_2011242469\_dok6,oHuCn6impHCVqcKHZpY.jpg).

There are absolutely gas chambers that had the blue residue:

As for why some gas chambers don't have residue? Well, thats because you can clean the residue, which the Nazis were attempting to do (as they were trying to erase evidence of the Holocaust), as the Soviet soldiers marched in.

#### Leuchter report (where's the ventilation?)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/twimem03 (1).png>)

Honestly, [Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leuchter\_report)covers this pretty well.

#### Survivors didn't see the gas chambers

![](../.gitbook/assets/twimem14.png)

This comes from a myth that Jews knew the showers were gas chambers before they were brought into them (I blame [Schindlers List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjy8Z1hK2wY) for this), but this is [not the case](https://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2015/08/knowledge-of-mass-extermination-among.html).

To illustrate this, consider the [case of a survivor named Maria Vanherwaarden](http://web.archive.org/web/19990421163441/http://ihr.org/books/kulaszka/21herwaarden.html):&#x20;

> From Linz, Herwaarden was transported to Vienna and from there to Auschwitz. There were about twenty other women on the train travelling from Vienna to Auschwitz. She could not say if any were Jewish. They received food on the train. A gypsy told Herwaarden that they were going to be gassed when they arrived at Auschwitz. They arrived in the camp on 2 December in the afternoon. (25-6625, 6626, 6627) That night the SS people came and took them to Birkenau. They were taken to a cold, windowless room and told that they had to take a cold shower. They handed over their clothes and all hair was shaved, both head and pubic. Herwaarden was "terribly scared" when she went into the shower room because "they said gas would be coming from the top but it was only water." They received soap, but the water was cold. When they finished, they received their numbers and prisoners clothing and were taken to the barracks. Herwaarden was listed as an Aryan. (25-6628, 6629)

Obviously someone who has survived the holocaust wouldn't see a gas chamber? If they did, they would be most likely lead to one and killed. Vanherwaarden did not see the gas chambers, but she did hear of them. Does Vanherwaarden never having seen the crematoria prove that they didn't exist? Obviously not, only that she personally didn't see them.

### Auschwitz had a swimming pool and a brothel!
