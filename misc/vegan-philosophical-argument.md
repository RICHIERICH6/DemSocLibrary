# Veganism Philosophical Argument

## Formal Argument

* Premise 1: Humans have non-trivial moral status just in case and because they have a certain trait.
* Premise 2: If humans have non-trivial moral status just in case and because they have a certain trait, then all beings have non-trivial moral status just in case and because they have that trait.
* Premise 3: Sentient animals have the trait that gives non-trivial moral status to humans.
* Conclusion: Therefore, Sentient animals have non-trivial moral status  \[^1\]

### Meat is Necessary in a Diet

No, just no. \[^2\]

### Killing Animals Is Okay Because It's Natural

This is just fallacious reasoning. Something being “natural” doesn’t mean it’s good, and there’s also the problem of “what does natural even mean?”

### Animals Eat Each Other

Not all animals eat each other, many animals in fact are herbivores.  The major problem with this though is that animal behaviour does not excuse our own, the fact that an infant vomits and poops all over itself doesn't mean it's okay for you to do so for others. Animals do all sorts of things to each other \(and to us\), including eating each other. Does this make it okay for us to do the same thing?

### Moral Agency

The most common trait used to respond to the formal argument would be the idea that animals do not have the ability to make moral judgements, so they do not deserve moral consideration. The problem is that certain animals \(elephants, whales, primates\) do infact show some levels of empathy or moral agency, similar to that of humans. Another problem is “well why does moral agency define moral value?”

If we in fact agree that only moral agents deserve moral consideration? What’s preventing us from killing babies or extremely mentally disabled people? What’s preventing us from doing so is because they are sentient and can feel so we give them moral consideration.

### Social Contract

This argues that since animals and humans cannot communicate and therefore cannot form a social contract, we do not give the animal moral consideration. If I were on an island stranded with others and there was no society there, does anybody on the island have moral consideration? Do homeless people deserve moral consideration?

### Intelligence

Similar to the above trait, this argues that animals are of significantly lower intelligence. This is probably the worst trait named because it is so easily applicable to humans. Once again, what’s preventing us from killing babies or extremely mentally disabled people? What would be immoral about super intelligent robots or aliens killing humans?

### Divine Command Theory \(WIP\)

This argues that since god dictates morality, and god allows us to kill animals, killing animals is morally acceptable. This goes into more about metaethics overall rather than veganism, so I will just summarize the problems with divine command theory:

* You'd have to establish that god even exists which is a whole other can of worms.
* If there are no moral standard other than God's will, then God's commands are arbitrary, which would mean morality isn't based off reason.

### No Ethical Consumption under Capitalism

The argument essentially removes the role of individual responsibility from a person who refuses to be vegan just because capitalism may be unethical. This is simply a nirvana fallacy, just because it may be impossible to avoid all wrongdoing doesn’t mean we don’t try to lessen harm. If I live in a society where slavery is allowed, it would still be immoral for me to buy a slave. If we agree that something is not worth doing simply because it doesn't solve the entire problem, then drinking water when thirsty is simply useless because it doesn't solve the issue of constantly needing water.

## Other Arguments

### Utilitarianism

I myself am not a utilitarian, but if you are one, you should absolutely be for veganism. 

* Vegans are usually healthier and have reduced risk at certain health conditions and therefore their well being is improved and therefore that is more utility in the world.
* A vegan diet is the single biggest way to reduce our environmental impact, better environment means more utility I'd imagine. \[^5\]

### Golden Rule

Pretty self explanatory really. If you were an animal, I presume you wouldn't like to be born just to be killed for someone elses pleasure.

### Companion Animals

* Premise 1: We should not inflict massive suffering upon or kill sentient companion animals \(e.g. dogs and budgies\) for reasons as trivial as taste pleasure.
* Premise 2: If we should not inflict massive suffering upon or kill sentient companion animals for reasons as trivial as taste pleasure, but it's OK to inflict massive suffering upon or killing sentient wild animals for reasons as trivial as taste pleasure, then there must be some morally relevant difference between sentient companion animals and sentient wild animals that is important enough to justify this radical difference in how it is OK to treat them.
* Premise 3: There is no morally relevant difference between sentient companion animals and sentient wild animals that is important enough to justify this radical difference in how it is OK to treat them.
* Conclusion: We should not inflict massive suffering upon or kill sentient wild animals for reasons as trivial as taste pleasure. \[^6\]
