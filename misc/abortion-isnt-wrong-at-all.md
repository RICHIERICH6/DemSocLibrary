  This will be defending all abortions by agreeing that even a fetus (whether it
  be sentient or unsentient) has a right to life.

# Abortion Isn't Wrong At All

## Formal Argument

* P1: The fetus is a person.&#x20;
* P2: Every person has a right to life.&#x20;
* C1: The fetus has a right to life.&#x20;
* P3: The woman has a right to control her body.&#x20;
* P4: The right to life outweighs the right to control one’s body.&#x20;
* P5: Abortion kills the fetus.&#x20;
* C2: Abortion is morally impermissible.

I'll defend Premise 4 as that is the contention with a classic analogy:

> You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist’s circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, “Look, we’re sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you – we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it’s only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.
