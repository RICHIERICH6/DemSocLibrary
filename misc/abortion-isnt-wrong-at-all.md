# Abortion Isn't Wrong At All

## Formal Argument

* P1: The fetus is a person.&#x20;
* P2: Every person has a right to life.&#x20;
* C1: The fetus has a right to life.&#x20;
* P3: The woman has a right to control her body.&#x20;
* P4: The right to life outweighs the right to control one’s body.&#x20;
* P5: Abortion kills the fetus.&#x20;
* C2: Abortion is morally impermissible.

I'll defend Premise 4 as that is the contention with a classic analogy:

> A woman wakes up to discover that she has been kidnapped in the night and hooked up to an unconscious violinist whose blood must be filtered through her kidneys for a certain period if he is to survive. The director of the hospital concedes that it was wrong of the violinist’s admirers to have hooked her up to him without her consent; nevertheless, he observes, “To unplug you would be to kill him,” and “A person’s right to life outweighs your right to decide what happens in and to your body.”

## Counter Arguments

### Responsibility Objection

The responsibility objection is a common counter to the violinist argument that basically says: "a woman who voluntarily engages in sexual activity is responsible for her fetus and therefore cannot have an abortion"
