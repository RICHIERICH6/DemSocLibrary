# Rent Control Bad

## Consensus

* Most economists **agree Rent Control is bad**. \([The Initiative on Global Markets](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/rent-control/)\)

## Inefficiency

* Landlords treated by rent control **reduced rental housing supply by 15%, causing a 5.1% city-wide rent increase**. \([American Economic Review](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24181/w24181.pdf)\)
* Rent control **limits renters' mobility by 20%**, the lost rental housing supply likely **drove up market rents in the long run, ultimately undermining the goals of the law**. \([American Economic Review](https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/DMQ.pdf)  \)
* Rent control **led to deterioration in the quality of rental units and encourage owners to shift units away from rental status and reduced rents substantially**. \([Journal of Urban Economics](https://moscow.sci-hub.st/1683/913de59f6942f26e9751b1bbb13bd990/sims2007.pdf)\)
* A one standard deviation move towards pro-tenant rent control variables **increases vacancy by 4.1 percentage points**. \([Centre for Social and Economic Progress](https://lusk.usc.edu/sites/default/files/working_papers/SSRN-id3811975_0.pdf)\)
* The long-term effects of the rent cap are still unknown, but **initial indications and the extensive empirical literature point to rather negative effects**. \([DIW Berlin](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.811443.de/21-8-3.pdf)\)
  * An overall welfare increasing effect is **doubtful from Rent Control**. \([Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research](https://liser.elsevierpure.com/ws/portalfiles/portal/27037019/WP_n_2021_03.pdf#page=34)\)
* We find **regressive effects of the Swedish system of allocating rental apartments through a que    as the largest subsidies go to higher income tenants that can afford market level rents.** \([Journal of the American Planning Association](https://gpc.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj8226/f/rentcontroldonnerkopschjan11.pdf#page=30)\)
