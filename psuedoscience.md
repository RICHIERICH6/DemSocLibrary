## Claim: "That wasn't real socialism!"

Let's say I have a theory, let's call it rainbowism. We want to create a rainbowist society which means that food will fall from rainbows for the workers--no one will have to work for anything anymore. And I get a group of rainbowists together and we take over a country. We set about implementing the rainbowist policy program. We shoot water into the air to create more rainbows, drop water from big airplanes, excitedly forecast the next storm which will produce rainbows, put rewards out for the capture of Leprechauns, and force everyone at gunpoint to pray to the big rainbow in the sky to give us food and plenty. It doesn't work. Meanwhile the farming and trade isn't getting done, because we are diverting the energy of the country into pursuing rainbowism. And we say, pray harder! Dump more water! The rainbows will come and give plenty to all! Meanwhile, people are starving and dying. And then I come along and say, you silly fools, you're never going to get a rainbow to give you free food! Quit trying! I say rainbowism has ruined the country. And along comes a true believer in rainbowism and says, no, rainbowism didn't ruin the country, the country never achieved rainbowism at all because free stuff never fell from the sky which is the definition of rainbowism, so obviously **this is not the fault of rainbowism or rainbowists, right?**

## Claim: "Grover Furr proved Stalin didn't do anything wrong!"

Grover, for all intents and purposes, is a **pseudo-historian to the likes of David Irvings**. Not even legitimate Marxist-Leninist historians take him seriously.
