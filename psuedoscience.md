## Claim: "That wasn't real socialism!"

Let's say I have a theory, let's call it rainbowism. We want to create a rainbowist society which means that food will fall from rainbows for the workers--no one will have to work for anything anymore. And I get a group of rainbowists together and we take over a country. We set about implementing the rainbowist policy program. We shoot water into the air to create more rainbows, drop water from big airplanes, excitedly forecast the next storm which will produce rainbows, put rewards out for the capture of Leprechauns, and force everyone at gunpoint to pray to the big rainbow in the sky to give us food and plenty. It doesn't work. Meanwhile the farming and trade isn't getting done, because we are diverting the energy of the country into pursuing rainbowism. And we say, pray harder! Dump more water! The rainbows will come and give plenty to all! Meanwhile, people are starving and dying. And then I come along and say, you silly fools, you're never going to get a rainbow to give you free food! Quit trying! I say rainbowism has ruined the country. And along comes a true believer in rainbowism and says, no, rainbowism didn't ruin the country, the country never achieved rainbowism at all because free stuff never fell from the sky which is the definition of rainbowism, so obviously **this is not the fault of rainbowism or rainbowists, right?**

### Claim: "Grover Furr proved Stalin didn't do anything wrong!"

Grover, for all intents and purposes, is a **pseudo-historian to the likes of David Irvings and other neo-Nazi historians.**

Gerald Meyer, a PhD historian [reviewed](https://0x0.la/u/uDggDpX.pdf) Grover's work and finds:

> Furr defends the Soviet state's expulsion of the Volga Germans, Tartars, Chechens, and other ethnic minorities from their homelands because of collaboration with the Nazis. However, these minority people were exiled before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Furr provides no evidence that these peoples were somehow in communication with the Nazis, plotting ways to undermine the defenses of the Soviet Union.

Gregory Elich [reviewed ](https://0x0.la/u/WW9rX7K.pdf)it and finds:

> Khrushchev charged that Yezhov could not have arrested and shot so many prominent party officials without Stalin’s decision. Furr confirms that Yezhov had many innocent people tortured and killed, but says that Stalin blamed Yezhov and quotes him as describing Yezhov as a “scoundrel” who “ruined our best cadres” \(304\). After the arrest of Yezhov for his excesses, the total number of arrests and executions dropped sharply. Although the scale paled in comparison to 1937–38, there were still nearly 169,000 individuals arrested in 1939–40. This hardly constituted an end to repression.

> It is too much to suppose that Stalin could not have seen anything amiss until the end of 1938, had he not set the repression in motion and looked favorably upon its progression. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to overlook the fact that the majority of his comrades in the Central Committee were being arrested and killed, with each accusation more improbable than the last. Nor could he have overlooked more than 1.5 million arrests and nearly 700,000 executions in the period 1937–38. The arrest of Yezhov had more to do with a policy change and a shifting of blame, than with a sluggish dawning of recognition.
