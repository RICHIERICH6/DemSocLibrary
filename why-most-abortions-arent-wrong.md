# Why Most Abortions Aren’t Wrong

## Sentientism

Theresa Ann Campo Pearson or as I will refer to her as Baby Theresa was born in Florida in 1992. Unfortunately, she was born with one of the worst genetic disorders one could have, it's fairly common and it’s named anencephaly. Anencephalic babies are sometimes referred to as “babies without brains”, and while that’s not an accurate description, functionally that is what they might as well be. Anencephalics miss the most important part of the brain, that being the cerebrum, which is the largest part of the brain and is responsible for consciousness. Sadly, an anencephalic will always die from cardio-respiratory arrest within a few hours or a few days. Knowing that Baby Theresa would die soon, her parents volunteered her organs for immediate transplant as infant organs are scarce, thousands of infants need transplants each year. When American children under the age of two are waiting for a transplant, 30 to 50 percent die before an organ becomes available. But to the parents’ dismay, Florida law forbade the removal of organs until the donor was dead. By the time Baby Theresa passed away, her organs had deteriorated too much to be harvested and transplanted. Within the medical and bioethics community, Baby Theresa’s case was widely debated. When first reading about this, it seemed like an open and shut case. It's wrong to kill someone, especially an infant just to save another person. Most of us would find that morally intuitive, but one has to ask “Who was Baby Theresa?”

In 1967, Christian Barnard performed the first ever successful heart transplant, a procedure that  saves many lives to this day. Back then, we understood death as occurring when your heart beat  stops, but this seems like faulty reasoning. Cardiac arrest involves the sudden loss of heart functioning, while many people unfortunately die from this, one can be resuscitated and live a  healthy life onward. We now understand death not as a single event, but a series of physical  events, it's not simply the cessation of breathing and heartbeat. Brain death is our new legal  standard for what we consider to be the end of one's life. This solved the problem about  transplants, because a brain-dead patient can still have a healthy heart, suitable for transplant.  While anencephalics do not technically fit the criteria of braindead, as their brain functions just  to a basically braindead extent, I still think it’d be fair to argue that Baby Theresa was never  really alive. Remember the word I mentioned earlier: “consciousness”. Consciousness is  responsible for the awareness of our world, without it, no one would exist and no one would  know that no one exists: “I think therefore I am”. It’s a scary thing to think about but just know  that you will always have experienced life but you will never have experienced death. An anencephalic will have never experienced life, which is unfortunate, but their body dying isn’t the thing that is unfortunate as they were already dead.  Now imagine if the Earth blew up, that would suck, not because the Earth would be personally offended but because of all the conscious beings destroyed, with their presumed desires and  interests thwarted. Now imagine a planet located in a galaxy besides the Milky Way, assuming  that there was no extraterrestrial life in this galaxy, if this planet were to be blown up, why would that be unfortunate? It may be a pretty looking planet but besides that nothing is really lost.&#x20;

Morality is a social phenomenon, this isn’t saying that it’s subjective, just that we as people use  ethics in our daily lives to determine whether to do something or not. Morality is defined by  “Principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior.”  Notice the word “behavior”, how could one possibly have good and bad behavior if there were no  conscious beings? How could one even judge the behavior if one isn’t conscious? Moral evaluation  requires consideration of preferences about the state of the universe, but to even consider that,  you’d have to have preferences which in turn requires consciousness.

I think I’ve given a sufficient enough explanation as to why consciousness is a prerequisite for having moral concern at all. In his Introduction to Applied Ethics, Peter Singer provides a pretty succinct explanation for this view:

> “The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a child. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because mice will suffer if they are treated in this way. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that the suffering be counted equally with the like suffering – in so far as rough comparisons can be made – of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account. This is why the limit of sentience (...) is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others.”>

## Relating to Abortion

If we can agree to this, then must ask why do we think abortion is immoral? Aren’t fetuses unconscious? It depends. It’s unanimously accepted in the study of prenatal perception that fetuses aren’t capable of feeling pain in the first trimester. Fetuses at around 8 weeks can respond to touch, but this is not a sign of consciousness. The venus flytrap responds to stimuli but isn’t conscious, as it's a plant.

A meta-analysis in JAMA Clinical Review finds that a fetus is not capable of feeling pain until “around 29 to 30 weeks' gestational age, based on the limited data available.” which would be the third trimester. In March 2010, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists submitted a report concluding that “Current research shows that the sensory structures are not developed or specialized enough to respond to pain in a fetus of less than 24 weeks" which would be the second trimester. A 2020 literature review in the Journal of Medical Ethics concluded that "an immediate and unreflective pain experience...from as early as 12 weeks.” which would be at the start of the second trimester.

So generally, the literature seems to suggest fetuses can feel pain as early as 12 weeks to 30 weeks. So wouldn’t most abortions be immoral since it is the killing of a sentient being? Well that depends on the country, in which I will talk about the US. According to the Guttmacher Institute, about 80.1% of abortions occur before 11-12 weeks, if we be generous and assume that prenatal perception does develop at around 12 weeks as this literature review proposes, then 80.1% of abortions would be morally permissible. If we look at the other study that proposes prenatal perception develops at around 29 weeks, then approximately 98.7 of abortions would ethically morally as 98.7% of abortions occur before the third trimester. Therefore, it reasons that abortion most of the time is morally permissible since the majority of them occur before the fetus is sentient.

These insights are not without controversy however, so I seek to respond to some of them.

## Counter Arguments

### Deprivation Argument

Don Marquis, bioethicist, in his paper "Why Abortion Is Immoral” not only challenges pro-abortion philosophy but why we consider murder to be wrong. In which he argues that killing someone is wrong because it deprives the embryo of a valuable future. Marquis begins by arguing that what makes it wrong to kill a normal adult human being is the fact that the killing inflicts a terrible harm on the victim. The harm consists in the fact that "when I die, I am deprived of all of the value of my future"

My first problem with the “deprivation argument” is that depriving someone of a valuable future isn’t limited to abortion or even murder. Imagine person A and B are in a race for a very valuable trophy that will lead them to a valuable future of glory and fame if they win, but if they lose they are disqualified from ever participating in any sport ever leading them to a deprivation of a valuable future in sports. Would it be wrong for either person A or B to win the race and deprive the other person a valuable future in sports?

If deprivation of potentially valuable futures is presumed to be a sort of responsible homicide, then culpable homicide occurs whenever a person is refused access to what he or she requires to survive. Homicide victims include a homeless guy who dies from exposure and an injured infant who dies due to a lack of a sufficient blood transfusion.

I would also say that a being can be seriously harmed by being deprived of a valuable future only if there are sufficient psychological connections and depriving a fetus of its future does not seriously harm it, unlike a sentient being with desires.

### Potentiality

Another common objection is one of potentiality, since fetuses are potential persons, we should ascribe them with all or at least some moral value comparable to a sentient baby. How does potentiality factor into the equation? How do you measure potential? If we use the dictionary definition of potential, it just means something having or showing the capacity to become or develop into something in the future, so by this definition don’t seemingly impossible feats have the possibility of happening? Let’s say there’s a technology being proposed by some multi billionaire entrepreneur that will be able to rearrange the atoms of a rock so much that it has sentience, would it be unethical for me to split a rock in half now, if let’s say in 50 years, that rock would have the potential to become sentient?

Another problem is that we don’t derive actual rights from the bare potential ability to have legal rights at a later time. If person X is President of the USA and thus is Commander in Chief of the army, then person X had the potential ability to become the President of the USA and Commander in Chief of the army in the years before his rule. But, it does not follow that: Person X has the authority to command the army as potential President of the USA.

### Sleeping

A common argument against this is that if we're allowed to kill non conscious beings, would it be okay for me to kill a sleeping person? The problem is that sleep is characterized by an altered state of consciousness, not unconsciousness. We can see that there are fast-frequency ripples in the hippocampus during deep sleep. Meditators who claim to be aware during deep sleep seem to be telling the truth as they display distinctive electrophysiological brain patterns, with high gamma-band frequency activity.

A sleeping person has desires and interests just like we do, and therefore they can be harmed when those desires and interests are thwarted. Of course, when you are asleep, you aren’t consciously holding any desires in your attention. But this is also true of most of your desires even when you are awake. If you love your children, you don’t stop loving them the moment you focus your attention on something else, like a football game. Likewise, you may not be thinking, as you read this “I don’t want to be killed” or “I value my car.” Yet it would still be wrong to kill you or steal your car.

These are called dispositional desires. You have dispositional desires even when you aren’t consciously focused on them, including when you are unconscious or asleep. Those dispositional desires only go away when you die or when your brain is irrevocably destroyed. But for you or any other entity to have dispositional desires, you must first have some initial first person conscious experience. A being that has never experienced desire of any kind can’t have long term desires.
