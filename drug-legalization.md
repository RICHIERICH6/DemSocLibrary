## The War On Drugs

### Racism

* The War On Drugs was explicitly racist, Nixon's domestic policy advisor [literally admitted to it](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman).
* Whites and blacks smoke weed at relatively the same rate, while blacks are **3.7x as likely to be arrested for a weed offense**. \([Justice Policy Institute](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/vortex.pdf)\)

### Inefficiency

* 95% of incarcerated addicts **will return to drug abuse after being released from prison,** 60 to 80% **of them will commit new crimes.** \([Skywood Recovery](https://skywoodrecovery.com/why-imprisonment-is-more-harm-than-help-to-addicted-offenders/)\)
* Locking up drug offenders **does not reduce drug use**. \([Pew](https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2018/03/pspp_more_imprisonment_does_not_reduce_state_drug_problems.pdf)\)

### Cartels

* The War On Drugs **raised the profits of cocaine cartels and manufacturers**. \([RAND](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2007/R3594.pdf)\)
* Drug prohibition likely **contributes to drug market violence and increased homicide rates and that increasingly sophisticated methods of disrupting illicit drug distribution networks may in turn increase levels of violence**. \([International Journal of Drug Policy](https://www.hri.global/files/2011/03/25/ICSDP_Violence_and_Enforcement_Report_March_2011.pdf)  \)

### Cost

* The War On Drugs **costs $100 billion annually.** \([OpenSocietyFoundations](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/how-much-your-money-wasted-war-drugs)\)
