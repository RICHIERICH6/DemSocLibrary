# Systemic Racism

## Criminal Justice System

### Policing

* Even when controlling for the respondents’ levels of offending, level of impulsivity, levels of anxiety and depression, gang membership, their family’s criminal involvement, whether they or their parents had serious mental health issues, the respondents’ current and expected economic conditions, their racial affinity, as well as other individual characteristics, **African Americans report significantly more trouble with the police**. \([Race and Justice](https://ia601404.us.archive.org/17/items/race-and-justice-volume-issue-2017-doi-10.1177-2153368717697104-unnever-james-ow/Race%20and%20Justice%20Volume%20issue%202017%20%5Bdoi%2010.1177_2153368717697104%5D%20Unnever%2C%20James%3B%20Owusu-Bempah%2C%20Akwasi%3B%20Deryol%2C%20Rustu%20--%20A%20Test%20of%20the%20Differential%20Involvement%20Hypothesis.pdf)\)
* After controlling for contextual and behavioral factors, we still found Black young adults were **arrested seven times more often than their White counterparts**. \([Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal](https://sci-hub.st/10.1007/s10560-019-00618-7)\)
* Law enforcement officers in Texas who could charge shoplifters with two types of crimes \(one more serious, one less so\) due to a vaguely worded statute **were more likely to charge black people and Hispanics with the more serious crime**. \([Journal of Empirical Legal Studies](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/jels.12201)\)
* Police targeting hot spots of crime **tends to disproportionately burden minorities via stops and arrests**. \([Justice Quarterly](https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/07418825.2019.1630471)\)
* Relative to whites, a black person in a car **is 2x as likely to be pulled over and 4x as likely to be searched**, despite the fact that **they’re less likely to be found with contraband as a result of those searches**. \([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/07/17/what-data-on-20-million-traffic-stops-can-tell-us-about-driving-while-black/)\)
  * When looking at 4.5 million traffic stops, we find that Blacks and Latinos **were more likely to be searched than whites**, even though **searches of white motorists were more likely than the others to turn up contraband**. \([The Annals of Applied Statistics](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-11/issue-3/The-problem-of-infra-marginality-in-outcome-tests-for-discrimination/10.1214/17-AOAS1058.full)\)
* Black-to-White arrests is **significantly higher under White sheriffs**. \([Economic Inquiry](https://people.ucsc.edu/~gbulman/lawenforcement_2019.pdf)\)
* **42%** of Florida Highway Patrol officers **practice racial discrimination**. \([American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20181607)\)

### Police Subconscious Bias

* Officers speak with **consistently less respect toward black versus white community members**, even after controlling for the race of the officer, the severity of the infraction, the location of the stop, and the outcome of the stop. \([PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2017/05/30/1702413114.full.pdf)\)
* White police are **more racially resentful and more likely to see blacks as violent, and more likely to minimize anti-black discrimination than are white nonpolice**. \([Sociological Forum](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319660605_More_Black_than_Blue_Comparing_the_Racial_Attitudes_of_Police_to_Citizens')\)
