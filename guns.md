## Counter Arguments

### Claim: "An armed society is a polite society!"

Not only do guns obviously increase homicide/suicide, but they don't make people more polite, in fact the opposite. This [study](https://0x0.la/u/u5zmJHr.pdf) finds that motorists with guns are** more likely to act aggressively**.

### Claim: "It's a mental health problem, not a gun problem!"

Internationally, [guns per capita is actually a stronger predictor of gun death than mental illness](https://www.amjmed.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0002-9343%2813%2900444-0#page=4), the [seriously mentally ill don't disproportionately commit gun crimes, they also use less guns in the crimes they do commit](https://files.catbox.moe/dyvtug.pdf).

### Claim: "The UK has banned guns, and they're experiencing high knife crime!"

The UK still has a [lower homicide rate than most of Europe and the US](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/homicide-rate?tab=chart\&time=earliest..2017\&country=GBR\~USA\~SWE\~DEU\~CHE\~POL\~FIN\~DNK\~FRA\~RUS). London, which is experiencing the highest rate of knife crime still has a [lower homicide rate ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_London#Homicide)than fucking [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Chicago).

### Claim: "Switzerland has high gun ownership and low homicide rate! This proves that guns protect people"

We could name a few countries that have low homicide **and** low gun ownership! Singapore, Japan, Slovenia, Norway, Australia/NZ, Taiwan, Poland, etc

Compared with the US, Switzerland and Israel [have lower gun ownership and stricter gun\
laws, and their policies discourage personal gun ownership.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267868/pdf/nihms-337067.pdf)

### Claim: "Gun control wont work because guns are trafficked!"

This is due to lack of gun control. As we can see [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/12/us/gun-traffickers-smuggling-state-gun-laws.html), guns are trafficked from states with weak gun laws to states with strong gun laws, empirically gun control [does reduce trafficking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704273/pdf/11524\_2009\_Article\_9351.pdf/).

### Claim: "But the ‘94 Assault Weapons Ban did not work!” 

The ban was riddled with [loopholes](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-assault-weapons-ban-had-flaws-2012-12).

But even then, this [study](https://www.hoplofobia.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2019-Changes-in-Mass-Shooting-Deaths-Associated-with-the-Federal-AWB.pdf) finds that mass-shooting fatalities were 70% less likely to occur during the 1994 to 2004 federal ban period.

### Claim: "98% of Mass Shootings Occur in Gun-Free Zones"

[No](https://www.gvpedia.org/gun-myths/occur-in/).

### Claim: "If the Jews had guns during the holocaust, the Nazis would've lost!"

[No](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/apr/08/viral-image/no-gun-control-regulation-nazi-germany-did-not-hel/).

### Claim: "John Lott proved that more guns means less crime in his book!"

John Lott literally creates alternative accounts to [praise his own work](https://twitter.com/timothywjohnson/status/1174410932451192834), he is for all intents and purposes, a hack. 

Now to critique the book, we can look at the US National Research Council, which[ reviewed his book](https://bafykbzacebq4lftss5iq2kqzddm2h5i5izdephml5tkmxhxur4atlzgstwwr6.ipfs.infura-ipfs.io/?filename=Charles%20F.%20Wellford%20-%20Firearms%20and%20Violence\_%20A%20Critical%20Review-National%20Academies%20Press%20%282004%29.pdf#page=15) and to quote:

> The committee found that answers to some of the most pressing questions cannot be addressed with existing data and research methods, however well designed. Indeed, the committee was unable to find any of the laws that it examined had any effect on crime or suicide rates. In the case of right-to-carry laws, despite a large body of research, the committee found no credible evidence that the passage of right-to-carry laws decreases or increases violent crime, and there is almost no empirical evidence that the more than 80 prevention programs focused on gun-related violence have had any effect on children's behavior, knowledge, attitudes, or beliefs about firearms. The committee found that the data available on these questions are too weak to support unambiguous conclusions or strong policy statements.

Tim Lambert[ reviewed it](https://files.catbox.moe/2czcw8.pdf) and finds:

> Even if we decide that there were more guns and less crime it is wrong to conclude that “more guns caused less crime”. The mechanism for causation proposed by Lott is not consistent with the empirical evidence on how often criminals encounter armed permit holders. The observed changes in crime rates are consistent with past changes in crime rates caused by factors other than concealed weapons and are inconsistent with the changes we would expect concealed carry to cause.

The American Journal of Public Health [reviewed it](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1380922/pdf/amjph00505-0032.pdf) and finds:

> We believe the flaws in Lott and Mustard's study of shall-issue laws are so substantial, and the findings so at odds with criminological theory and research, that any conclusions about the effects of shall-issue laws based on this study are dubious at best.

The Journal of Legal Studies[ reviewed it](https://johnrlott.tripod.com/Black_and_nagin.pdf) and finds: 

> A more general model based on year-to-year differences yields no evidence of significant impact for any type of violent crime. As a result, inference based on the Lott and Mustard model is inappropriate, and their results cannot be used responsibly to formulate public policy.

Stanford Law Review [reviewed it](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2240\&context=fss_papers) and finds: 

> We conclude that Lott and Mustard have made an important scholarly contribution in establishing that these laws have not led to the massive bloodbath of death and injury that some of their opponents feared. On the other hand, we find that the statistical evidence that these laws have reduced crime is limited, sporadic, and extraordinarily fragile

A response was made to the Stanford Law Review report but this has been replied to already and has been debunked and[ summarised here](https://www.gvpedia.org/gun-myths/plassmann-and-whitley/).

A [2008 article](https://files.catbox.moe/nldyqn.pdf) in Econ Journal Watch surveyed peer-reviewed empirical academic studies, and found that 10 supported the proposition that right-to-carry reduces crime, 8 supported no significant effect and none supported an increase. The article was [reviewed and debunked](https://econjwatch.org/File+download/236/2009-01-ayresdonohue-com.pdf?mimetype=pdf) by Ian Ayres and John J. Donohue in the same journal in 2009.

Lott has also [misrepresented other academic work to further his cause](https://www.gvpedia.org/gun-myths/more-guns-mean-less-crime/).

### Claim: "Kleck proved that gun defense happens 2.5 million a year"

Kleck is one of the most discredited gun researchers in academia.  Only 3% of gun researchers [agree that there are more than one million self-defense gun uses each year](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1264/2014/05/Expert-Survey18-Results.pdf).

The National Academy of Sciences [reviewed his study](https://0x0.la/u/48dhNK7.pdf#page=282) and finds:

> He presents no sensitivity analyses of alternative adjustment procedures, and some of them are incompletely documented. Our calculations indicate that making alternative plausible assumptions would substantially decrease Kleck's estimates of annual self-defense uses.

The Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology[ reviewed it](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6936\&context=jclc) and finds:

> The conclusion seems inescapable: the Kleck and Gertz survey results do not provide reasonable estimates about the total amount of self-defense gun use in the United States.

The US Department Justice also [reviewed it](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf) and finds:

> Thus, it is of considerable interest and importance to check the reasonableness of the NSPOF estimates before embracing them. Because respondents were asked to describe only their most recent defensive gun use, our comparisons are conservative, as they assume only one defensive gun use per defender. The results still suggest that DGU estimates are far too high

Injury Prevention [reviewed it](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/injuryprev/10/2/96.full.pdf) and finds:

> These findings cast doubt on rates of DGUs reported in an influential study by Kleck and> \
> Gertz

Kleck has literally under oath [admitted ](https://bit.ly/3xKRMkC)that he failed to control for illegal and immoral gun uses in his DGU study.

> We made no effort to assess the lawfulness or morality of the R's defensive actions

Kleck has then gone on record to say that say that [36 to 64 percent reported in his study were likely illegal](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6938\&context=jclc#page=6).\
This was confirmed when Hemenway found that** **[51 percent of defensive gun uses in a large survey were illegal according to a panel of 5 judges](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/injuryprev/6/4/263.full.pdf)**.**

In 1997, conservative criminologist James Q. Wilson [wrote in the New Republic that Lott’s estimates are not reliable and researchers should rely on government surveys](https://newrepublic.com/article/101311/hostility-in-america): 

> Using the data compiled by the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) of 56,000 families, scholars have estimated that there are, at a minimum, between 65,000 and 80,000 defensive gun uses per year.

This is small in comparison to the 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent gun crimes.

[**TLDR**](https://www.gvpedia.org/gun-myths/use-guns-defensively/)**, **[**TLDR2**](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/defensive-gun-ownership-myth-114262)\
