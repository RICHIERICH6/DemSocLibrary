# Economic Calculation Problem

The economic calculation problem says that without a proper pricing system, **you cannot properly allocate factors of production that best suit the subjective values of consumers**. The ECP assumes:

* Complete information as to every consumer demand
* The relevant quantities and qualities of all the different factors of production, both original and produced 
* All of the technological recipes known to man in existence for producing consumer goods
* Complete agreement on what exact course of action to take regarding what needs to be produced

The director wants to build a house. Now there are many methods that can be resorted to. Each of them offers, from the point of view of the director, certain advantages and disadvantages with regard to the utilization of future building, and results in a different duration of the buildingâ€™s serviceableness; each of them requires other expenditures of building materials and labor and absorbs other periods of production. Which method should the director choose? He cannot reduce to a common denominator the items of various materials and various kinds of labor to be expended. Therefore he cannot compare them. He cannot attack either to the waiting time (period of production) or to the duration of serviceableness, a definite numerical expression. In short, he cannot, in comparing costs to be expended and gains to be earned, resort to any arithmetical operation. The plans of his architects enumerate a vast multiplicity of various items in kind: they refer to the physical and chemical qualities of various items in kind; they refer to the physical productivity of various machines, tools, and procedures. But all their statements remain unrelated to each other. There is no means of establishing any connection between them.

Stalin had partly admitted the ECP as a difficulty of the Soviet Union's economy, to [quote](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1951/economic-problems/ch04.htm):

> The trouble is that our business executives and planners, with few exceptions, are **poorly acquainted with the operations of the law of value, do not study them, and are unable to take account of them in their computations**. This, in fact, **explains the confusion that still reigns in the sphere of price-fixing policy**. >
