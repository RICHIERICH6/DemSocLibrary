# Zoning Reform

## Inefficiency

* Zoning reform **would boost GDP by 14% to 36%, and wages by $1.3 to $3.4 trillion**. \([The Library of Economics and Liberty](https://www.econlib.org/a-correction-on-housing-regulation/)\)
* Zoning and other land use controls, **play the dominant role in making housing expensive**. \([NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w8835/w8835.pdf)\)
* The gap between the price of housing and the cost of construction is **accounted for by zoning acting as a regulatory tax**. \([NBER](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w10124/w10124.pdf)\)
* Small developers **cannot overcome the burdens imposed by downzonings**. \([Yale Law Journal](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/1162_m41e7ifa.pdf)\)
