# Public Housing

## Voluntary Homelessness?

* **91 to 96%** of Pheonix homeless **reported wanting to leave the streets**, suggesting **4-9% were there voluntarily**. ([United States](https://books.google.com/books?id=PS8gAAAAMAAJ\&pg=PA597#v=onepage\&q\&f=false))
* **78%** of Pheonix homeless reported **wanting to leave the streets**, suggesting **22% were there voluntary**. ([United States](https://books.google.com/books?id=PS8gAAAAMAAJ\&pg=PA1037#v=onepage\&q\&f=false))
* **37% to 43%** of Pheonix homeless could **start working again tomorrow if there were jobs for them**. ([United States](https://books.google.com/books?id=PS8gAAAAMAAJ\&pg=PA597#v=onepage\&q\&f=false))

## Cost

* It would **cost only $20 billion to end homelessness in the US**, according to HUD. ([ThinkProgress](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/infographic-we-could-end-homelessness-with-the-money-americans-spend-on-christmas-decorations-6b49b415668c/))

## Finland

* Using the staircase approach, Finland **more than halved homelessness by 1994**. ([Cityscape](https://0x0.la/u/w4UVmBP.pdf))
* Public housing tenants **engage in neighborhood work, such as collecting litter or maintaining parks**. ([Cityscape](https://0x0.la/u/w4UVmBP.pdf#page=4))

## United States

* Vouchers **significantly reduced homelessness, crowding, household size, and the incidence of living with relatives or friends**. ([Housing Policy Debate](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.530.3116\&rep=rep1\&type=pdf))
* Supported housing for homeless people with mental illness **results in superior housing outcomes than intensive case management alone or standard care and modestly increases societal costs**. ([JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/207801))
* Permanent supportive housing programs have **demonstrated positive outcomes for participants with criminal histories**, yet participants** continue to exit to jail or prison and experience subsequent homelessness**. ([Psychological Services](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/nchav/docs/CusackMontgomery_ExaminingBidirectionalAssociationBetweenVeteranHomelessness.pdf))
* The HUD-VASH program **worked as intended and veteransâ€™ homelessness would have risen substantially over the past decade without the program**. ([American Journal of Public Health  ](https://sci-hub.st/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305231))
* A national Housing First model for the VA would be **associated with improved outcomes for Veterans experiencing homelessness**. ([Journal of Community Psychology](https://sci-hub.st/10.1002/jcop.21554))
