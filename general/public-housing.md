# Public Housing

## Voluntary Homelessness?

* **91 to 96%** of Pheonix homeless **reported wanting to leave the streets**, suggesting **4-9% were there voluntarily**. \([United States](https://books.google.com/books?id=PS8gAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA597#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
* **78%** of Pheonix homeless reported **wanting to leave the streets**, suggesting **22% were there voluntary**. \([United States](https://books.google.com/books?id=PS8gAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1037#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
* **37% to 43%** of Pheonix homeless could **start working again tomorrow if there were jobs for them**. \([United States](https://books.google.com/books?id=PS8gAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA597#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
* **46%** of Portland homeless reported **having military experience**. \([United States](https://books.google.com/books?id=PS8gAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1031#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)

## Cost

* It would **cost only $20 billion to end homelessness in the US**, according to HUD. \([ThinkProgress](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/infographic-we-could-end-homelessness-with-the-money-americans-spend-on-christmas-decorations-6b49b415668c/)\)

## Housing First

* Using the staircase approach, Finland **more than halved homelessness by 1994**. \([Cityscape](https://0x0.la/u/w4UVmBP.pdf)\)
* Public housing tenants engage in neighborhood work, such as collecting litter or maintaining parks. \([Cityscape](https://0x0.la/u/w4UVmBP.pdf#page=4)\)

## Hud-vash

* Supported housing for homeless people with mental illness **results in superior housing outcomes than intensive case management alone or standard care and modestly increases societal costs**.
* Permanent supportive housing programs have **demonstrated positive outcomes for participants with criminal histories**, yet participants **continue to exit to jail or prison and experience subsequent homelessness**. \([Psychological Services](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/nchav/docs/CusackMontgomery_ExaminingBidirectionalAssociationBetweenVeteranHomelessness.pdf)\)
* The HUD-VASH program **worked as intended and veteransâ€™ homelessness would have risen substantially over the past decade without the program**. \([American Journal of Public Health  ](https://sci-hub.st/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305231)\)
* A national Housing First model for the VA would be **associated with improved outcomes for Veterans experiencing homelessness**. \([Journal of Community Psychology](https://sci-hub.st/10.1002/jcop.21554)\)
