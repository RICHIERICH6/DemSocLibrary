# Carbon Dividend

## Consensus

* Most economists **support a carbon tax**. \([The Initiative On Global Markets](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/carbon-taxes-ii/)\)
* Over 3,500 economists **support a carbon dividend**. \([Climate Leadership Council](https://clcouncil.org/economists-statement/)\)

## Economy

* A carbon dividend in the US would **cause the creation of 2.8 million jobs, and an increase in GDP of $1.375 trillion dollars over 20 years**. \([Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://11bup83sxdss1xze1i3lpol4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Economic-Climate-Fiscal-Power-and-Demographic-Impact-of-a-National-Fee-and-Dividend-Carbon-Tax-5.25.18.pdf)\)
* The carbon tax in British Columbia **caused a 0.74% annual increase in employment**. \([Journal of Environmental Economics and Management](https://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/econ/files/info/unitis/publications/1-7729354/Yamazaki_CarbonTax_JEEM_2017.pdf)\)
* **No connection is found between carbon price implementation and diminished economic growth**. \([Socius](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2378023119898326)\)

## Efficiency

* A carbon dividend in the US would **cause a 50% reduction of CO2 below 1990 levels, which would result in 230,000 fewer premature deaths**. \([Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://11bup83sxdss1xze1i3lpol4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Economic-Climate-Fiscal-Power-and-Demographic-Impact-of-a-National-Fee-and-Dividend-Carbon-Tax-5.25.18.pdf)\)
* A carbon tax had **increased low-carbon innovation among regulated firms by as much as 10%, while not crowding out patenting for other technologies**. \([Review of Economics and Statistics](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-pdf/98/1/173/1616446/rest_a_00470.pdf)\)
* The carbon tax in British Columbia **reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 5% to 15%**. \([Energy Policy](https://files.catbox.moe/h6grxl.pdf)\)
* Carbon tax has **reduced CO2 emissions from the German electricity sector by 35 to 60 Mtons**. \([Energy Economics](https://files.catbox.moe/7qoaht.pdf)\)
* British carbon tax **lead to a 93% drop in coal-fired electricity**. \([Phys](https://phys.org/news/2020-01-british-carbon-tax-coal-fired-electricity.html)\)
* Swedish carbon tax **decreased carbon emissions by about 11%**. \([American Economic Journal](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/pol.20170144)\)
* Carbon tax reduced **energy intensity by 18.1% and electricity use by 22.6%, and no significant impact on employment, revenue or plant exit**. \([Journal of Public Economics](https://files.catbox.moe/dmw3ne.pdf)\)
* Subsidies targeted at a particular abatement method are **far less efficient than carbon pricing**. \([Economic Papers](https://twin.sci-hub.se/5845/9ca4f7024b3c663939c24f9412ff71d4/freebairn2014.pdf)\)
* A carbon dividend **would not harm households in the lowest income quintile.** This **supports the idea that the tax can reduce emissions without hurting low income households**. \([Resources for the Future](https://media.rff.org/documents/RFF20WP2018-22dc.pdf)\)
