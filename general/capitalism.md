# Capitalism

## Claim: "That wasn't real socialism!"

![](https://i.imgur.com/KVLGgPe.jpg)

Let's say I have a theory, let's call it rainbowism. We want to create a rainbowist society which means that food will fall from rainbows for the workers--no one will have to work for anything anymore. And I get a group of rainbowists together and we take over a country. We set about implementing the rainbowist policy program. We shoot water into the air to create more rainbows, drop water from big airplanes, excitedly forecast the next storm which will produce rainbows, put rewards out for the capture of Leprechauns, and force everyone at gunpoint to pray to the big rainbow in the sky to give us food and plenty. It doesn't work. Meanwhile the farming and trade isn't getting done, because we are diverting the energy of the country into pursuing rainbowism. And we say, pray harder! Dump more water! The rainbows will come and give plenty to all! Meanwhile, people are starving and dying. And then I come along and say, you silly fools, you're never going to get a rainbow to give you free food! Quit trying! I say rainbowism has ruined the country. And along comes a true believer in rainbowism and says, no, rainbowism didn't ruin the country, the country never achieved rainbowism at all because free stuff never fell from the sky which is the definition of rainbowism, so obviously **this is not the fault of rainbowism or rainbowists, right?**

## **Claim: "The** [**Waitzkin study**](https://sci-hub.se/10.2190/AD12-7RYT-XVAR-3R2U) **proves that poor socialist countries having higher development than poor capitalist/non socialist countries!"**

## Claim: "The [Navarro study](https://sci-hub.se/10.2190/B2TP-3R5M-Q7UP-DUA2) proves socialism is good!"

Commies will cite this study but leave it out of context, if you read the study it says:

> the socialist experience \(in both its Leninist and its social democratic traditions\) has been, more frequently than not, more efficient in responding to human needs than the capitalist experience.

Even the study "proving" socialism as good agrees that social democracy is a good system.

They try to say that Socialism is better for Latin America because Cuba has a higher life expectancy:

> Since then, the health indicators have improved more rapidly in Cuba than in the rest of Latin America.

The problem with citing life expectancy for Cuba is that they're heavily skewed by the regime. [Econlib ](https://www.econlib.org/about-that-cuban-life-expectancy/)writes: 

> Cuba, with a ratio of 6, was a clear outlier. **This skewed ratio is evidence that physicians likely reclassified early neonatal deaths as late fetal deaths, thus deflating the infant mortality statistics and propping up life expectancy**.

> Coercing or pressuring patients into having abortions **artificially improve\[s\] infant mortality by preventing marginally riskier births from occurring help\[s\] doctors meet their centrally fixed targets**.

They also claim that China is a socialist success because life expectancy has improved over feudal china: 

> Furthermore, although health indicators have improved significantly in China as   
> compared with India, they have done so at similar levels of per capita GNP. China has   
> much better health indicators at similar per capita GNP levels

Not only is Feudal China ****[**an embarrassingly low bar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion), China isn't even socialist anymore[, **they are a capitalist economy, they have been since 1983**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform). This study was done in 1992 to be fair, so they couldn't have foresaw the [**giant improvements China has made ever since capitalism**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rainerzitelmann/2019/07/08/chinas-economic-success-proves-the-power-of-capitalism/?sh=63cd9bc53b9d). Also, life expectancy \(and health\) has [**massively been improved by Capitalism**](capitalism.md#health).

## Marxism-Leninism

### Claim: "Grover Furr proved Stalin didn't do anything wrong!"

Grover, for all intents and purposes, is a **pseudo-historian to the likes of David Irvings and other neo-Nazi historians.**

Gerald Meyer, a PhD historian [reviewed](https://0x0.la/u/uDggDpX.pdf) Grover's work and finds:

> Furr defends the Soviet state's expulsion of the Volga Germans, Tartars, Chechens, and other ethnic minorities from their homelands because of collaboration with the Nazis. However, these minority people were exiled before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Furr provides no evidence that these peoples were somehow in communication with the Nazis, plotting ways to undermine the defenses of the Soviet Union.

Gregory Elich [reviewed ](https://0x0.la/u/WW9rX7K.pdf)it and finds:

> Khrushchev charged that Yezhov could not have arrested and shot so many prominent party officials without Stalin’s decision. Furr confirms that Yezhov had many innocent people tortured and killed, but says that Stalin blamed Yezhov and quotes him as describing Yezhov as a “scoundrel” who “ruined our best cadres” \(304\). After the arrest of Yezhov for his excesses, the total number of arrests and executions dropped sharply. Although the scale paled in comparison to 1937–38, there were still nearly 169,000 individuals arrested in 1939–40. This hardly constituted an end to repression.

> It is too much to suppose that Stalin could not have seen anything amiss until the end of 1938, had he not set the repression in motion and looked favorably upon its progression. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to overlook the fact that the majority of his comrades in the Central Committee were being arrested and killed, with each accusation more improbable than the last. Nor could he have overlooked more than 1.5 million arrests and nearly 700,000 executions in the period 1937–38. The arrest of Yezhov had more to do with a policy change and a shifting of blame, than with a sluggish dawning of recognition.

### Claim: "The USSR had higher nutrition and calorie consumption than the US!"

### Claim: "USSR had most doctors in the World!"

### Claim: "The Gulags weren't that bad!"

> Report from the CIA which found some interesting things about the gulags, including that between 65% and 95% of prisoners \(depending on the camp\) were imprisoned for genuine crimes \(such as theft, murder, rape, etc.\) rather than political offenses.

~~nice that the source library is trying to justify gulags x3~~

So what? This sounds like when a conservative argues "He didn't deserve it but.... He was no angel!" when a black person is killed by a cop. 

Just because some of the prisoners may have committed a legitimate crime doesn't excuse the terrible almost slave-tier working conditions these prisoners faced. Remember that 1.6 million people died there, that doesn't even happen in US prisons, assuming the gulag ran for 25 years, that's literally 176 deaths per day.

Andrei Vyshinsky, chief procurator of the Soviet Union, wrote a memorandum to NKVD chief Nikolai Yezhov in 1938 [which stated](https://web.archive.org/web/20090224230330/http://atlasandco.com/images/uploads/samples/pdf/InsideStalinArchives-web.pdf):

> Among the prisoners there are some so ragged and lice-ridden that they pose a sanitary danger to the rest. These prisoners h**ave deteriorated to the point of losing any resemblance to human beings**. **Lacking food…they collect orts \[refuse\] and, according to some prisoners, eat rats and dogs**.

During the Holodomor, ****[**prisoners were getting around 300 calories \(1,300 kJ\) worth of food a day. Many inmates attempted to flee, causing an upsurge in coercive and violent measures. Camps were directed "not to spare bullets"**](https://bafykbzaced642r3wd3hxlzurbihrkhy3bp5apb3tyupftafdggxfjmkwtbwtm.ipfs.infura-ipfs.io/?filename=%28Annals%20of%20Communism%20Series%29%20Oleg%20V.%20Khlevniuk%20-%20The%20History%20of%20the%20Gulag_%20From%20Collectivization%20to%20the%20Great%20Terror-Yale%20University%20Press%20%282004%29.pdf#page=84).

### Claim: "But Commies contributed to technology!"

Commies also contributed to pseudoscience.

All humanities and social sciences were **additionally tested for strict accordance with historical materialism**. These tests were [**alleged to serve as a cover for political suppression of scientists who engaged in research labeled as "idealistic" or "bourgeois"**](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacebfdfdmslglraojxtilspavuikhsdmmpbg7wpuq6apfppp66fma34?filename=%28Cambridge%20Studies%20in%20the%20History%20of%20Science%29%20Loren%20R.%20Graham%20-%20Science%20in%20Russia%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union_%20A%20Short%20History-Cambridge%20University%20Press%20%281993%29.pdf).

## Venezuela

### Claim: "Venezuela High Reliance on Oil Harmed them, not Socialism"

![](https://cdn.mises.org/dani5_1.png)

Not all oil-exporting countries are undergoing crises, and those countries that do suffer from a crisis do so much less severely than Venezuela.

### Claim: "Sanctions Destroyed Venezuela"

This [study ](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/impact-of-the-2017-sanctions-on-venezuela_final.pdf)by the Brookings Institute finds that:

> While we recognize the possibility that the sanctions may have had some impact on Venezuela’s oil production, **our analysis finds insufficient evidence to conclude that they were responsible for the worsening of the socio-economic crisis**.

Furthermore, sanctions [began in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Venezuelan_crisis#2015), while the crisis began in 2010, did they travel back in time?
