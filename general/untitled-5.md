# Public Education

## Efficiency

* When controlling for socio-demographics characteristics, there is **no advantage to private schools**. \([Educational Researcher](https://www.gwern.net/docs/sociology/2018-pianta.pdf)\) \([National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pdf/studies/2006461.pdf)\)
* In the aggregate, charter schools **aren't very useful**. \([Journal of Economic Literature](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21523/w21523.pdf)\)
* Increased public education is **associated with increased educational mobility**. \([Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](http://www.oecd.org/social/broken-elevator-how-to-promote-social-mobility-9789264301085-en.htm)\)
