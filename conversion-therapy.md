# Conversion Therapy

## Consensus

* **Over 40+** health organizations **oppose conversion therapy**. \([Florence Ashley](https://medium.com/@florence.ashley/list-of-professional-organisations-opposing-conversion-or-reparative-therapy-targeting-transgender-f700b4e02c4e)\)

## Ineffectiveness

* A literature review of 47 studies **finds that conversion therapy is either ineffective, harmful or null results.** \([Cornell University](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-whether-conversion-therapy-can-alter-sexual-orientation-without-causing-harm/)\)
* A survey of 40,000 LGBTQ+ **finds that conversion therapy doubles the suicide attempt rate**. \([Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Trevor-Project-National-Survey-Results-2020.pdf#page=7)\)
  * Trans individuals who recall exposure in trans conversion therapy report **significantly higher rates of suicidality, pyschological distress, and illicit drug use**. \([JAMA](http://www.suarakita.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Association-Between-Recalled-Exposure-to-Gender-Identity-Conversion-Efforts-and-Psychological-Distress-and-Suicide-Attempts-Among-Transgender-Adults.pdf)\)
* Attempts to change sexual orientation **may cause or exacerbate distress and poor mental health in some individuals, including depression and suicidal thoughts**. \([American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf#page=42)\)

## Counteraguments

### Claim: "What about ACPeds?"

The American College of Pediatricians is a [**think tank disguised as a health organization**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/201705/the-american-college-pediatricians-is-anti-lgbt-group).

### Claim: "This [study ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1025647527010)proves conversion therapy works!"

The author of this study, Robert L. Spitzer, has [**renounced this study**](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/robert-spitzer-ex-gay-psychiatrist-apology_n_1453570) and [**criticized anti-LGBT organizations for using to to fuel their agenda**](http://www.truthwinsout.org/blog/2012/05/25725/).

### Claim: "This [meta-analysis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2466/pr0.2002.90.3c.1139) proves conversion therapy works!"

The APA has [**debunked** ](https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf)it:

> A meta-analytic review of 14 research articles \(Byrd & Nicolosi, 2002\) is not discussed in this report. The review **suffers from significant methodological shortcomings and deviations from recommended meta-analytic practice** \(see, e.g., Durlak, Meerson, & Ewell Foster, 2003; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001\) that preclude reliable conclusions being drawn from it.
