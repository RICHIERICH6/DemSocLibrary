# Conversion Therapy

## Consensus

* Over 40+ health organizations are **against conversion therapy**. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion\_therapy#List\_of\_health\_organizations\_critical\_of\_conversion\_therapy))

## Ineffectiveness

* A literature review of 47 studies **finds that conversion therapy is either ineffective, harmful or null results.** ([Cornell University](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-whether-conversion-therapy-can-alter-sexual-orientation-without-causing-harm/))
* A survey of 40,000 LGBTQ+ **finds that conversion therapy doubles the suicide attempt rate**. ([Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Trevor-Project-National-Survey-Results-2020.pdf#page=7))
  * Trans individuals who recall exposure in trans conversion therapy report **significantly higher rates of suicidality, pyschological distress, and illicit drug use**. ([JAMA](http://www.suarakita.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Association-Between-Recalled-Exposure-to-Gender-Identity-Conversion-Efforts-and-Psychological-Distress-and-Suicide-Attempts-Among-Transgender-Adults.pdf))
* Attempts to change sexual orientation **may cause or exacerbate distress and poor mental health in some individuals, including depression and suicidal thoughts**. ([American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf#page=42))
* Literature review finds claims of conversion therapy effectiveness **to be unreliable**. ([Association for Psychological Science](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1529100616637616))
* 88% of participants **failed to achieve a sustained change in their sexual behavior and 3% reported changing their orientation to heterosexual**. The remainder reported either losing all sexual drive or attempting to remain celibate, with no change in attraction. Some of the **participants who failed felt a sense of shame and had gone through conversion therapy programs for many years**. Many respondents **felt harmed by the attempt to change, and reported depression, suicidal ideation and attempts, hypervigilance of gender-deviant mannerisms, social isolation, fear of being a child abuser and poor self-esteem**.
