# Modern Monetary Theory

* Modern Monetary Theory doesn't have a **testable, falsifiable hypothesis that we can compare against mainstream economic theory**. ([BadEconomics](https://old.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/9kulc8/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/e72l0o7/?context=3))
* MMT's novel policy prescriptions **do not follow cogently from its premises**. ([American Economic Association  ](https://0x0.la/u/Nr9649r.pdf))
* An MMT agenda of having fiscal authorities manage monetary policy runs the risk of very high debts, inflation, or bothâ€”and both **can be very harmful to the broader economy**. ([Mercatus Center  ](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/sumner_and_horan\_-\_policy_brief\_-\_how_reliable_is_modern_monetary_theory_as_a_guide_to_policy\_-\_v1.pdf))
* MMT has been attempted in Latin American countries and has **caused runaway inflation,  **\
  **huge currency devaluations, and precipitous real wage declines**. ([Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2019-09/cj-v39n3-3.pdf))
