### Discrimination



## Pseudoscience

### Claim: "This [study](https://0x0.la/u/ZoH9GyV.pdf) in Sweden proves transitioning increases trans suicide!"

No, this isn't what the study claims. Here's an excerpt:

> no inferences can be drawn as to the effectiveness of sex reassignment as a treatment for transsexualism. In other words, the results should not be interpreted such as sex reassignment per se increases morbidity and mortality. Things might have been even worse without sex reassignment.

The study is just saying that people who had transitioned are still a endangered population compared to cis people, not that transitioning worsened suicide.

The author literally clarified this in an [AMA](https://web.archive.org/web/20210513231529/https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6q3e8v/science_ama_series_im_cecilia_dhejne_a_fellow_of/dkuk2tr/).
